Well...I do like a big toaster oven
Whatever
How can you love me and tell me not to be literal?!?
Convective broilers
Well stated.
It’s a 360 convective broiler
Clearly I’m not.
Frying is frying and is defined by immersion in fat.
That’s not pedantry, that’s fact and it’s a fact worth understanding.
Barely
EXACTLY!!!
I endorse this message
I love this so much
I would have told you your turkey is on fire but didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of Thanksgiving dinner  in another direction.
Absolute truth
It’s the only cookie I dream about.
There is no such thing as “air frying.” 
So stop talking about it like it’s a thing.
Because...no
Can you share the recipe?
On it
I spotted it first, dammit!
I am with you.
Just wrapped the new season of Good Eats: The Return.
Thank you to my crew for not killing me and for amazingly expressing their talents all while wearing masks and face shields and washing their hands 375 times a day.
Cooking up something wicked...delicious.
Don't miss #GoodEatsTheReturn's Halloween special, The House That Dripped Chocolate, coming to @FoodNetwork next Thursday, October 8 at 9 PM EST.
Last night was...our anniversary.
Check out the highlights below, or catch the full show here : LINK  
Sprinkles suck
Landing
Two Benadryl and several bourbons...but no not really.
Belize
The hero we need.
Done
Point taken.
I’m not watching anymore.
Embarrassing on both sides.
Dear #Godzilla...NOW!
But is it?
Or is it about man’s constant battle with God?
Gentlemen, you can’t fight in here.
This is the war room!
I hear @MerriamWebster is updating their definition of “shit show.”
Hey guys...what’s on TV?
Does that mean “Cutthroat Kitchen?”
The #barbuto cookbook is finally here!
I have no idea where to start.
Tonight at 8pm eastern #QuarantineQuitchen will be live with @IngramElizabeth and me drinking an appropriate amount in preparation for whatever may happen later...you know...at 9.
Done
Well done!
Professional only!
No. It’s a canapé.
No. It certainly isn’t.
Don’t use carrots.
One of my proudest moments. 
Therefore: tacos are @tacos and are deserving of their own culinary category.
Burritos are enclosed wraps.
Henceforth my definition of “sandwich” is: any food designed to be conveyed to the mouth by fingers whereby the food and fingers are separated by leavened bread which directly juxtaposes at least two sides of the filling and is consumed along with the filling.
Furthermore, “open-face” sandwiches are big, fat fakers...not sandwiches at all!
Oh, and once and for all: a hotdog sure as s__t is a sandwich.
We're still not sure whether we drank rum or bourbon...but here's a taste of what else you missed on last night's #QuarantineQuitchen.

Cheesecake is in fact a custard pie.
Don’t bother replying in the negative.
Just adjust your world view and move on with life.
Let me put this to rest: cheesecake is pie.
At 7:55 tonight @IngramElizabeth and I will remove our clothing.
At 8:00 we will begin a live episode of #QuarantineQuitchen on my #youtube channel.
(At 7:58 we will hastily re-dress...or will we?) 
That’s right...I have my own rhino!
 I know I’ll probably never meet Apollo but I sure do like being able to help him, even from half a world away.

Dear @SenatorLoeffler, Attila the Hun was referred to as “Flagellum Dei.”  I know you don’t know what that means  but you might want to have someone google it.
