I love, love, love this talk with @adamcarolla about cancel culture.
Man speaks the truth!
Listen here: LINK 
I know Richie, and he most definitely has his life together.
Happier than he’s ever been.
This is who @TheRealSambora is, and he very much “has his act together,” @jonbonjovi, as you well know.
“How Richie Sambora Helped Megyn Kelly's Son After Teacher's Death”
“There's not a day that goes by that I don't wish that Richie had his life together… 
In a weird way, it's because of his inability to get it together anymore that we went on and wrote This House Is Not For Sale.”
What a low-class attack on the guy who made you a star, Jon Bon Jovi.
@TheRealSambora is the most genuine, kind, giving friend, dad, human there is.
No one has a bad word re: him-except you, always you.
Guess you need att’n for your new album?
Sad.
“Subject” is very strong for any song by America.
Stop that right now.
For me it was my mom, Blondie, and “The Tide is High.”
P.s. Is Katie real?
Surely she’s trolling us with “putting a leash on a dog” is subjugation as is buckling a child seat”?
Dear Men: Katie doesn’t speak for us.
Dear Katie: being a strong woman doesn’t mean shaming men for common courtesy.
Some of us absolutely love it.

Please start by unfollowing me!
So much easier!
I actually hadn’t clicked thru to the article and I should have.
It’s just another “Trump is awful” piece - not one celebrating his possible death.
My bad - looks like WAPO actually only meant to tweet out its latest hate piece on Trump, which basks in how wonderful it would be if he loses, not dies.
The fact that you think this tweet, from the Washington Post,  was just fine if one buys that they didn’t know Trump had COVID when they sent it is further proof of your blinding hatred when it comes to DT, Tim.
Praying for you Dan. 💕
As promised, my favorite interview ever with @tedcruz!

This is how one shows grace despite political differences
Wishing President Trump,  Melania Trump and Hope Hicks a quick recovery from COVID-19.
Omg don’t listen to those idiots
This is ridiculous!
Tomorrow morning we drop my favorite interview ever with @SenTedCruz.
Get it as soon as it's  released by subscribing to my podcast, @MegynKellyShow here: LINK

Or, just not in the tank for Biden and able to report fairly on both sides.
While I appreciate your website taking a break from watching The Bachelor & The Kardashians to try its hand at news analysis, consider trying it my way!
It’s really not hard.
Weird sweater!
Yates
It does look like I am naked!
Ha!
It’s just an off-the-shoulder sweater.
Curriculum night by zoom is not bad.
Best thing I have seen all day.
Try not to smile.
My second podcast - the first presidential debate!
Director Wray went on to clarify that the group is indeed a “movement,” a “real thing,” “not a fiction” that “engages in organized tactical activity at the local & regional level,” & it’s “dangerous.” 
To summarize this position w/“he said it’s an idea not an org” is dishonest.
I’m genuinely curious - toward whom do you think I am biased?
I’m there too!
Now!
Will be dropping our second podcast by Wed afternoon with complete post-debate analysis... and here’s a secret: 
we’ll have Ds AND Rs w/reaction.
Hope you will download & subscribe (it’s free) to The Megyn Kelly Show on Apple podcasts, etc.
Dems already saying there shouldn’t be any more debates.
Not a chance they cancel the others.
Can you imagine how weak Biden would look?
Surfed over to MSNBC - there is no Republican on the panel analyzing this debate.
And don’t say Nicole Wallace who is basically TV’s Jennifer Rubin.
Big winner of the night: Kanye?
Keep the moderator on cam &amp; give him/her the ability to cut the mics.
They will stop talking.
What a $&amp;@%show.
Biggest loser of this debate: us!
Wallace shutting down the Hunter line of attack isn’t going to please the Trump supporters.
Also - TENSE AND UNCOMFORTABLE exchange
Biden: “Antifa’s an idea, not an organization.”
Trump: “you gotta be kidding me.” 
Point: TRUMP
Biden’s retort was good - he puts gasoline on everything.
Biden: “there’s nothing we can’t do if we do it together!”
Protesters: raise the fist and say BLM or get the F away from your table. 🤔
Argh!! I wanted to hear Biden’s answer to that!!!
This is it: “why aren’t you saying the words law enforcement??”
Biden capable of landing blows when not interrupted
Annnddd... once again Biden ruins his good moment with a personal insult.
“He doesn’t want to let me answer bc he knows i have the truth” - best line from Biden so far
Trump took no real heat on taxes.
His biggest liability in this debate is what it is outside of this debate: looks like a bully.
Biden keeps erasing the advantage with name calling.
Strong answer again by Trump on his most vulnerable subject (COVID) arguing against the shutdowns.
My kids lol’ing about the “size of his mask” crack.
Biden takes what was a very strong answer on “do you trust him after all the lies” and ruins it by insulting Trump then seizes on.
Omg low road low road moment on “smart.”
This is Trump’s strongest answer.
On COVID.
Biden takes the bait: 
“will you shut up man?” That’s a fail for him.
Trump’s base will love his aggression; suburban moms and older voters?
Not so sure.
Biden calls Trump a clown before we hit the 18 min mark
Pocahontas!
Drink!
Biden can’t control Trump; keeps asking Wallace to help him.
Not a good look.
Handle it Mr. VP
Trump actually did prepare.
Biden on message: 
Obamacare, Obamacare, Obamacare...
#PresidentialDebate
Biden looks pale.
But then everyone does next to Trump.
#PresidentialDebate2020
@charlescwcooke on a serious tear here against that absurd apology letter from the OH St prof who - had the unmitigated nerve!
 - to call for the return of college football.
Laughed out loud reading CCWC.
Well done.
Thx @meghan_daum -more is on the way!
Post debate analysis tomorrow
Thank you for taking the time to listen!
Bc Wallace or his prep team would have to have leaked it.
I know them all, and they are above reproach.
There is zero chance that’s true.
Here’s what we have coming up the rest of this week on my new podcast-launch week of the @MegynKellyShow:
Loved this talk with @RubinReport.
First time I have ever responded “Bite me” to a Q (not directed at Dave of course).
“[A] community activist who works in [an area w/] many of the city’s Black residents...[says she] is in favor of more police officers.
‘The [City Council] didn’t engage Black & brown people’ [on defunding police, leaving] this community & me unsafe.’”
Happy Birthday D - may this year be the best one yet. 💕
Here’s what we have coming up this week.
Launch week of the @MegynKellyShow:
Today: @ggreenwaldPost-debate show with @krystalball and @esaagar, @hughhewitt

My first podcast, very exciting!
 @GGreenwald sat down with me to discuss the election, the state of the media, &amp; the revolt v. Joe Rogan at Spotify.
He’s fascinating, check it out here: LINK 
My 9-year-old daughter Yardley was the last person to use my shower before me.
Look what appeared on the glass door as it steamed up. 💕
This is such a great follow.
@DougBrunt is not an unbiased reviewer but check it out anyway!
 Go to Apple podcasts (or wherever you get your podcasts) & download The Megyn Kelly Show.

The Q is tax evasion (illegal) v tax avoidance (legal - most people try it) in the NYT Trump taxes story.
But Trump is not the only rich presidential candidate trying to dodge as many taxes as possible.
Thunder = happiness &amp; calm.
People can see the emptiness of these racist attacks on @DanielCameronAG and know he followed the law.
As he put it earlier this week, “in a world that is forcing many of us to pick a side, I choose the side of justice.
I choose the side of truth.” Same.
Guys, they’re going to attack her decision to adopt two children.
Her mothering.
And her/her children’s race.
Say a prayer for Amy Coney Barrett and her family tonight, and for the lost souls who think this is ok.
So we’re all ok with open, bigoted attacks on Catholics now?
Just trying to keep up.
Hey @NYGovCuomo - @JaniceDean is not giving up.
She and the other grieving families deserve answers.
Great job JD!
An honest, unbiased & spot-on (as usual) legal take from @AndrewCMcCarthy on the Breonna Taylor case.
Harry &amp; M, in an undisguised attempt to gain pity” opted “to portray the Prince..as a victim of oppression...The entire British state had conspired to ensure that Harry-for no reason other than..being a Prince-had never enjoyed the right of the common man” 
Open the schools 
Starting next week...
Two Louisville PD officers shot last night (non-life threatening injuries)... two cops seen on camera being shot in execution attempt in Compton, & look at this video from Seattle.
Disgusting, stomach-turning terrorism.
This was done beautifully, heart-breakingly and with class.
Praying for you Dan.
The Get Out the Vote effort for Trump continues!
 They’re doing an amazing job!
 (Ps - watch this video. 
 Just watch it.) 
This (and Bork) was the beginning of it all.
It’s the heart of the “you reap what you sow” argument against the Dems.
They broke the norms first.
