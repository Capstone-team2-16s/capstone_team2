Great article and perspective from my friend who worked in the White House with President Reagan -- and how he feels for the workers there now in the #COVID__19 world. 
Excited to contribute and help answer @TheWeek‚Äôs big question alongside @annehelen @gracyolmstead and 
@CynthiaGreenlee
Palm Beach Gardens Fire Rescue Station 65 was manned by a shift made up of all women for the first time in the history of the department, since it was founded in 1963.

Uhhh ... THIS 
Omg - what about if he had worn a mask? 
#COVID19 #TrumpHasCovid 
Never happens to men ‚Äî just ALL female candidates. 
This is apolotical folks. Pls stop! 
#WeHaveHerBack 
and now the President saying he won't do the 2nd debate virtually. 
that's because you can actually be muted on zoom. 
#PresidentialDebate2020
haha
NDAs are the kiss of death for people in ANY workplace because you can never say what happened to you if the environment turns toxic. 
It's why we're working to eradicate them @LiftOurVoicesUS-- join us! 
this changes A LOT
Well this changes a lot. 
Next Presidential debate will be VIRTUAL. 
I've always said much more tough for nterruptus to take place when Biden & Trump won't be on the same LIVE stage together. 
Much easier to cut off mics & video. 
It's called MUTE. 
#PresidentialDebate2020
Oh wow what a new sexist approach
Thanks for the levity ..... 
never
Please dear God ask the question tonight about VP Mike Pence claiming men shouldn't go to business dinners anymore with women b/c of they just might not be able to control themselves. Please dear God ask this.

It‚Äôs debate night! 
What better time to say ‚Äî Sexist media coverage of all women candidates has no place in 2020. 
We need to put all journalists on notice (& I can say it as part of that group!) 
#wehaveherback 
Always the highlight of my day!! 
@RandyRainbow is brilliant! 
It was time!

And 4 years and 3 months to the day since my story about suing Roger Ailes at Fox News came to light. 
Courage is contagious. 
Let‚Äôs keep this cultural revolution moving  and stop silencing women too with NDAs.

Why are we ok with treating female candidates like this from either party? 
Come on ‚Äî we are better than this and we have all backs.

I need this today .... 
The most popular Democrat @MichelleObama comes out swinging with a closing argument for @JoeBiden 
I just can‚Äôt 
this .....
so wrong
Yes !!!!!
This is so outrageous.
For a photo op?
You put lives at risk?
I'm so sorry for the secret service and I pray none get sick or worse.
OMG
Obviously Dr. Conley felt he had to tell the American public more info than yesterday ....
so there were some details.
But then, the same pattern ... more questions with no answers.
#covid19 
#TrumpHasCovid
Potential discharge of President Trump tomorrow from Walter Reade and back to the WH.
#TrumpHasCovid
More honesty from the President's Dr. right now.

Happy Saturday!
My autographed shoes are now up for auction for the 12th Annual ‚ÄúKick Up Your Heels‚Äù fundraiser to benefit

The arts gave me so much growing up as a violinist!
Question of the day: WHEN WAS THE LAST NEGATIVE TEST THE PRESIDENT OF THE United States RECEIVED?
#covid19 
#TrumpCovid
funny if it weren't so serious
Just to be clear ...
Fox News not covering this point.
And ... using an experimental therapy on President Trump potentially to thwart the symptoms -- 
maybe so he wouldn't have to tell the American public he had #Covid19 or at the very least when he knew he had it?
#TrumpCovid
Wow. 
#TrumpCovid
So what's the real timeline of when the President knew he was #Covid19 positive?
His doctor said 72 hours ago.
If that's true he went to NJ and MN knowing he had symptoms?
#TrumpCovid
totally
And didn't get the test at the debate on Tuesday ...
How will this affect all of the ABC people Christie was sitting next to on debate night LIVE on air?
Remember.
Chris Wallace has said President Trump arrived too late to the debate to take a #Covid19 test (as was required).
That was Tuesday night.
Thursday night he was positive.
There's more reporting to be done here.
#TrumpCovid
good point.
meant about my experience
Brit Hume has a history of being a blowhard about things he knows nothing about.
He was one of the first to malign me publicly just like this after I filed my harassment case against Roger Ailes at Fox.
Whose surprised
Exactly ... wish I could comment more about that source
I wish I could comment
Wow
wow
Let me get this straight.
Pres Trumps family refused to wear masks at debate even when asked by Cleveland Clinic reps.
Pres still goes to NJ fundraiser after knowing Hope Hicks tested positive.
At Supreme Court presser attendees shook hands, hugged & were maskless.
How selfish.
How stupid ‚Äî all of those people at the White House event for Supreme Court pick shaking hands and not wearing masks ‚Äî now it‚Äôs turned into a #COVID19 super spreader event.
#TrumpHasCovid

Let‚Äôs stop arbitration and NDAs too!
COVID-19 has led 1 in 4 women to contemplate downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce entirely, 1 in 3 moms may be forced to scale back or opt out.
Companies must rise or risk unwinding years of progress for gender equality.
#WomenInTheWorkplace
yes!
I thought this was supposed to end at 1030pmET.
Pls take us all out of our misery.
#PresidentialDebate2020
Depressing
The sad thing is ... take politics out of it ... this is not how we raise our kids.
Do we teach them to have ....
No respect, to bully, to not follow the rules (that his campaign agreed to by the way).
#PresidentialDebate2020
This is embarrassing ...
#PresidentialDebate2020
Agree
Jealous
Haha
Haha
Chris Wallace is appealing to Trump to stop interrupting.
This is like a toddler having a tantrum.
Too bad nobody can get a timeout.
#PresidentialDebate
They need you Doris!
Biden: It‚Äôs hard to get any word in with this clown.
#PresidentialDebate
This is a s*** show.
Nobody can control him I don‚Äôt think.
Cut his mic!!!
I have a colonoscopy tomorrow!
No wine ... no nothing!
Biden: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst President America has ever had‚Äù 
#PresidentialDebate
Finally ‚Äî Chris Wallace demands an answer about trumps taxes.
#PresidentialDebate
Wallace to Trump: ‚Äúyou‚Äôve agreed to the 2 minutes‚Äù.
This is why they should cut the mic when they don‚Äôt honor the 2 minutes 
#PresidentialDebate2020
Was thinking exact thing
Trump accuses Biden of not being able to get the crowds ‚Äî and if he could ... that Biden would hold the same gatherings he‚Äôs been holding advocating no masks.
#debate
Great idea
Thank you!
Interesting how Joe Biden has been coached to not look at Pres Trump ‚Äî speaking straight forward.
Maybe because Trumps strategy is to malign and degrade.
Quote: ‚ÄúNothing smart about you Joe.‚Äù 
#debate
Trump says he disagrees with his own person on when the vaccine for #covid will be ready.
#debate
Trump: ‚ÄúYou could have never done the job Joe ‚Äî it‚Äôs not in your blood.‚Äù 
#Debates2020 
#debate
Biden finally says it: shut up.
#DebateTuesday 
#debate
Too bad the rule for this debate wasn‚Äôt that the candidates had to wear masks to shut up when the other one is talking.
#DebateTuesday 
#debate
VP Joe Biden takes off the gloves ‚Äî says everything Trump says is a liar.
#Debate2020 
#Debate
Wow ‚Äî Trump trying to steamroll Chris Wallace ‚Äî saying he‚Äôs debating Wallace and saying he‚Äôs not surprised.
#debate
Chris Wallace obviously nervous for this debate ... will he be able to control this debate?
#Debates2020 
#debatetuesday
So the gloves are off now ‚Äî the discussion portion will be where the fireworks are between Trump and Biden
