Important to realise - In UK as elsewhere if/when #COVID19 vaccine is available, the vulnerable will be vaccinated as a priority 👇
Mr Barnier is now in a meeting with Angela Merkel
A lot of “open issues” remained in talks he said.
Adding that people both sides of Channel had already been through much bc of #coronavirus 
It therefore would be “totally irresponsible to burden them with additional problems resulting from a no-deal" he said
Germany’s Foreign Minister has met the EU’s chief negotiator in trade talks w UK Michel Barnier this morning.
Mr Maas: “The coronavirus pandemic made the discussions even more difficult and I mean in every respect but it also made an agreement even more urgent."

As we heard from leaders like NL’s Rutte and Germany’s Merkel, they are ‘cautiously optimistic’ BUT while a deal is thought likely, it’s far from definite.
EU view is still that decision must ultimately be made in Downing Street.
Though the PM insists it depends more on the EU
Fish is not THE key issue but it is a key bargaining chip and do will be agreed close to last.
Neither EU nor UK will want to be seen to be the first to give up on these negotiations.
EU diplomats think they could continue into November
Well-connected EU diplomat told me he thinks Michel Barnier will have to push EU leaders to show more flexibility.
Angela Merkel seemed to nod to that on Friday.
The U.K. will need to move considerably on its current official positions on level playing field and governance
The fact the two leaders didn’t issue a joint statement trumpeting the details of compromise solutions already being worked on doesn’t mean they can’t or won’t happen.
Fact that PM and VdL will be in regular contact now is significant.
Lots more to-ing and fro-ing predicted
It would seem neither the wildly positive sounding rumours out of the U.K. last week on agreed solutions being found to state aid, nor the doom and gloomsters saying nothing is going nowhere fast(!) on tough issues in talks following the PM-VdL phone call this week are correct
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier heads to Berlin tomorrow morning for a meeting with Angela Merkel.
No trip scheduled to France the following day.
Possibly to London later in the week, I’m told
@pmdfoster used ‘meh’ in a tweet recently and it reminded me how much I like the word!
I’ve found myself using it all over the place last few days
If deal does appear, EU diplomats suggests won’t be before beginning/mid November
Themselves, then why on earth publicise that for politicians (mainly uk - rest of EU bored by #Brexit ) and media (mainly uk bc European press will only become interested if deal/no deal has domestic impact) to pull apart?
Lots of work to be done behind scenes
What a meh joint statement from Boris Johnson and EU Commission Pres this afternoon.
No tunnel.
Just intensified negotiations - What was the point?
you could ask OR It could be a positive sign they said so little.
If compromises are there to be made and both sides are readying
fisheries, the level playing field, and governance.. but not only those subjects, they noted.
They’ve agreed to keep in touch regularly from now on
Eu Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Boris Johnson have issued a joint statement following their call this afternoon.
Negotiations to agree a trade deal are now to be intensified.
Significant gaps remain (on well-known areas):
Good thread on what to expect next in #Brexit trade talks w EU.
This is political crunch time.
Deal can only be reached with EU + UK compromise and as I keep writing : 
don’t forget EU leaders -not just the PM - are affected by domestic politics 👇
ALL EU members are united in negotiations in prioritising welfare of single market over a deal with UK because EU countries earn a varying but considerable chunk of GDP out of that market.
That said, some in EU like Sweden, NL more open to some compromise than France for example
EU also not a clear cut case now we’re at the hard compromise-making stage.
Some member states open to being more flexible, others, eg France, don’t so much.
What I mean by flexible is not the fabled German carmakers.
“Since U.K. leaving the EU single market and customs union anyway, what’s the point of a deal that requires us to tie our hands to agreed rules with the EU?
Better to cut lose completely and have full sovereignty”
Complicating matters when it comes to the EU and U.K. ‘positions’ in the final stretch of negotiations ..
There are different voices around the PM - some more keen to do a deal with EU, others who say:
How significant is tomorrow's video conference between Boris John and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen: 
Is a trade deal about to be struck - or just more same old finger-pointing?
My thoughts: LINK 
But as @DavidHenigUK points out - very VERY unlikely either EU or UK will allow talks to collapse over fish - however totemic the issue is
Brussels has to show more realism said David Frost - a recognition that post Brexit UK is an independent country.
He concluded that the UK remained committed to finding solutions - if they were to be found - he said
Angela Merkel and EU leaders sounded (very very) cautiously optimistic about possibility of a trade deal but UK’s chief negotiator David Frost struck sombre note.
Eg On fishing he warned  the gap with the EU risked being impossible to bridge
For many the virtual meeting tomorrow between the prime minister and the European Commission President is an encouraging sign.
Others - more wary - point out that just ahead of their call - each is still looking to the other to make concessions - in public at least #Brexit
The EU can sign a trade deal with UK despite triggering legal action over government’s internal market bill BUT the European Parliament says it will not ratify the deal if the government doesn’t remove the contentious clauses from the Bill that would override Withdrawal Agreement
Rutte also said a no-deal outcome would be “a big lost opportunity” on top of the economic fallout from the corona virus pandemic
Dutch PM Mark Rutte says he’s “cautiously optimistic” that EU-UK trade deal will be agreed this autumn.
Says “geopolitical necessity” for a deal was felt in Brussels and London bc covid and general instability
On subject of post #Brexit trade deal today Mrs Merkel said: 
A lot will be determined by what Britain wants and what Britain does not want.
It is up to Britain to decide this really.
But as long as the negotiations keep going I am optimistic.
Reports that EU chief negotiator will fly to Berlin on Monday for talks with Germany’s Angela Merkel
And on the parallel talks with UK on how to implement last year's Brexit Divorce Deal 
- she said everything was there to sort out the difficulties over the Irish Protocol and she called for it to be implemented in good faith
She said if UK wants "full access to single market" it would need to "respect questions of fairness and competitiveness".
She mentioned the importance to EU of having a dispute mechanism written in to the deal.
She said it was worth working hard to achieve a deal
As to whether she felt optimistic that a deal would be done, President VdL said "Where there is a will there is a way.
We have made progress in many fields" but added that most difficult aspects: fishing and level playing field esp state aid - are still "wide open" she said
but rejected word 'tunnel' to describe how negotiations should proceed.
President von der Leyen repeated well-known EU position  "We want a deal.
Better to have a deal as neighbours.
Also in times of covid - with its devastating economic consequences but not at any price."
European Commission President says her video conference with PM tomorrow is to take stock of negotiations and look ahead to the what next.
She will then inform EU leaders of the outcome of the conversation with Boris Johnson.
She mentioned need to intensify negotiations.
Indeed.
Though EU imagines if deal struck that will be far easier for Boris Johnson to do as the concerns reflected in the internal market bill will largely be dealt with in a zero tariff, zero quota agreement
NB I wrote ‘meeting’ in /7 .
Should read ‘conversation’.
No suggestion they are meeting in person at this stage
The why’s and what’s of tomorrow’s meeting is speculation for now.
The only thing we know for sure is: both sides say they want a deal.
But both say not at any price.
If a deal does eventually emerge, compromises will have to have been made by both sides
Macron is under pressure to compromise his maximalist position on fishing rights for EU fishermen in U.K. waters but it’s politically v sensitive for him.
He already has 2022 presidential elections on his mind.
Key rivals could accuse him of sacrificing French interests.
Media likely to scrutinise/attack compromises -making it harder for politicians to agree them.
This goes for the PM -who could (depending what’s agreed) be accused of compromising on #Brexit by some media and MPs in own party - but also for EU leaders like Emmanuel Macron.
There is real progress going on in negotiations but need (either optics or content) the political involvement of PM & Commission President.
Also if progress is in process of being made (ie politically difficult compromises),the two sides won’t want to come under press scrutiny
Unusual that there is no Barnier press conference today.
There normally is after negotiating rounds.
Could be bc there is an EU leaders summit going on separately in Brussels (discussing Turkey, Belarus and more) and EU wants to avoid press conference clashes OR 
Today the two chief negotiators David Frost (UK) and Michel Barnier (EU) meet after this week’s negotiating round.
There have been rumours of progress on key sticking points coming out of UK.
Not confirmed EU side so far
BREAKING: PM spokesperson says Boris Johnson will speak to European Commission President tomorrow to discuss state of EU-UK trade and security talks.
QUESTION: Will they announce enough progress being made that negotiating teams can now enter a media black-out tunnel?
Millions of congrats @BBCVickiYoung who has been announced as @BBCNews new Deputy Political Editor.
Am told Michel Barnier will not be briefing EU leaders about #Brexit at their Brussels summit tomorrow.
European Commission Pres will hold the Briefing while M Barnier meets UK chief negotiator David Frost.
No Barnier presser planned - v unusual after negotiating weeks.
Hmmmm..
Indeed.
But what EU did not do is take stronger action : halt trade negotiations.
As important to look at what EU did not do as what it did in this case, I think.
EU wants trade deal and hopes that would go long way to allaying any UK stated concerns about NIreland
Who is Belgium's new Prime Minister - in charge of a 7 party coalition put together nearly 18 months after general election ..?
EU set 30Sept deadline for UK government to withdraw parts of internal market bill that would override aspects of Irish Protocol contained in #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
EU wants to show it keeps its word yet wants to avoid huge row.
Still hopes trade deal.
Hence slow process👇
“We need to create a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK’s internal market, ensure Ministers can always deliver on their obligations to Northern Ireland and protect the gains from the peace process.” says the spks.
In response to EU sending a letter of notice to government as party of infringement proceeds, government spokesman says: 
“We will respond to the letter in due course.
We have clearly set out our reasons for introducing the measures related to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Yet the threat by No10 to break international law has been damaging amongst own MPs + internationally.
EU says will insist all the more now on having an independent body to police any eventual trade deal w U.K. - so as to be able to take swift legal action in case of disputes
So was it a ‘successful’ negotiating ploy by Downing Street all along?
You could say gov called the EU’s bluff.
Brussels threatened legal action over Bill but is actually clearly playing it slowly.
Doesn’t want to damage chances of agreeing a trade + future relations deal w UK
Allow progress in the committees with the U.K. to implement the Irish Protocol and Withdrawal Agreement at large to solve difficulties between the two sides.
If clear progress made on a) and b) in a month, EU hopes the problematic parts of Internal Market Bill become irrelevant
By giving the government one month, the EU hopes this will give time for both sides to progress towards a) an EU-UK trade deal, which could allay fears of U.K. gov about aspects of the Irish Protocol in Withdrawal Agreement and b)
Commission will give government one month to respond it says.
Meantime the Commission ‘stands by its commitments’ (this is a jab at Boris Johnson) and ‘will continue working hard to ensure timely implementation of withdrawal agreement’ says president von der Leyen
European Commission Président says sent letter of formal notice to UK government - the first step in infringement proceedings.
This, because has not removed party’s of internal market bill that could override aspects of #Brexit Withdrawal agreement 
Financial services aren’t part of EU-UK trade talks but issues are linked.
Securing equivalence for UK services -allowing post #Brexit access to single market -will arguably be easier if a trade deal is agreed BUT EU can withdraw equivalence unilaterally👇
I thought it odd too.
It does also appear in English-language version of the Spiegel but why not write letter in UK publication 
- if aimed at UK?
Germany’s Europe Minister has appealed for “cool heads” “pragmatism” and a “sensible solution” in a letter to the UK as post #Brexit trade negotiations enter the final phase.
He calls too for an end to “obsession” with who’s winning or losing in talks 👇
Yes.
And off record, EU national diplomats often say this isn’t a big issue for EU but state aid (the other issue affected by Internal Market Bill) is huge for them.
Could be tactics -Keep something up sleeve that’s easy to compromise over to bargain for another thing you want??
Michael Gove says U.K. and EU are willing to use “every second every minute every hour” to reach agreement on implementing the Withdrawal Agreement BUT EU says it’s seen no sign from government they will remove parts of internal market bill that override that co-signed agreement
PM’s spokesperson says while this week is the final formal round of EU-UK trade negotiations, he expects discussions to continue up to the EU leaders’s summit on 15 October.
He described atmosphere in talks as relatively positive – but that ‘much was to be done’..EU in agreement
EU Commission Vice Pres says “We are determined to do our utmost to get a deal on a Future partnership (with the U.K.) and on implementing the Withdrawal Agreement but a lot depends on what UK brings to the table”
“A lot if these decisions are politically sensitive but technical in nature (eg IT systems, VAT regime) so we will need to speed up frequency of meetings” says EU Commission Pres Sefcovic regarding meetings of the EU-UK committees for implementing Withdrawal Agreement 
“It’ll never be the EU who walks out on the negotiations” says EU Commission Vice Pres Sefcovic of the EU/UK trade talks #Brexit
EU says Brussels and UK still far apart on issue of whether businesses need to fill out exit declarations for goods leaving Northern Ireland
Maros Sefcovic EU Commission Vice President says got no indication today from Michael Gove that gov is planning to remove “contentious” parts of internal market bill.
That’s why he said the EU was looking at “all means available” to take legal action #Brexit 
EU Commission Vice Pres Sefcovic met Michael Gove in Brussels today in 3rd meeting of Joint Committee designed to oversee implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement aka Divorce Deal -huge EU concern has been the Internal Market Bill 
Huge #Brexit week starts today:It’s the last scheduled round of EU-UK negotiations to work out trade + other future relations eg police cooperation, security.
Today there’s an EU-UK meeting to discuss Internal Market Bill and if Downing Street intends to break the Divorce Deal 
Know you e heard it before but it really is crunch time this week in post #Brexit negotiations w the EU.
MEPs warning that the flow of medicine is endangered if no deal.. in the middle of a pandemic👇
Switzerland has voted to keep EU’s freedom of movement rules.
Switzerland is not an EU member and polls suggest majority prefer to retain sovereignty over laws and borders BUT most voters opted today to keep ties with EU (economic benefits)👇 
Keep an eye on Switzerland today..
Holding a referendum to end free movement - a key part of its relationship with the EU.
Many see lessons for UK’s post #Brexit relationship with Brussels here.
If the Swiss vote Yes today.. 
Yes👇EU leaders unlikely to engage till hear from Barnier there’s movement from UK.
Even then there’ll likely be quite some to and fro.
If/when deal almost there, it’s thought PM might meet EU Commission Pres before sign off of deal at General Affairs Council (not leaders summit) 
Bluster and posturing aside, how close are we to an EU-UK post #Brexit trade deal?
My thoughts from Brussels ahead of next week‘s formal negotiating round👇 
Honoured! Thank you.
Reaction in Brussels to this article 👇 is that either A) Downing Street is sending a message via journalist that it is now willing to make compromises - thereby immediately making a deal more likely (as Eu already said it‘s willing to compromise) OR ..
EU response to this👇is that « preparedness » will certainly be brought up at the Joint Committee meeting with Michael Gove on Monday.
Brussels says he has given EU his word that the Protocol will be implemented so EU taking his word for it ..
This week’s EU leaders summit now delayed as the host - European Council Pres Charles Michel - has gone into quarantine.
This, after a security officer with whom he was  “in close contact early last week” tested positive for Covid 19 
« The EU will not be renegotiating » 👇says bloc’s chief representative on the Joint Committee (JC) -the body created to oversee implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement - ahead of meeting his UK equivalent, Michael Gove next week
