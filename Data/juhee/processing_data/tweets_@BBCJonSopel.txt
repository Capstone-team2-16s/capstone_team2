Someone‚Äôs got his voice back....
Good pedantry.
I like pedantry.
And correct usage.
Thank you
Dr Phillips is a Covid-19 expert and attending physician at #WalterReed 
This is @realDonaldTrump supplemental oxygen tonight: the cheers of the crowd.
My report while it happened outside #WalterReedMedicalCenter
Unbelievable scene outside #WalterReed 
- @realDonaldTrump has just driven past slowly to wave at his supporters
üòâ
üí§ üí§ üõè
The flapping of the men in white coats....
Both excellent for radio...
Our latest...and recorded this morning before latest medical briefing 
Woah. This is big.
Though taken after debate and before @realDonaldTrump was taken ill.
I think the polling among seniors is also really interesting - a demographic Trump won in 2016
This is so joyous....
Latest medical bulletin on @realDonaldTrump - key quote ‚Äòwhile not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic‚Äô
You‚Äôre kidding, right?
Video message from the president at #WalterReed this evening
Goodness.
Hope all is ok....
ü§î
Lot of support for @realDonaldTrump outside #WalterReedMedicalCenter where he‚Äôs being treated for #coronavirus
Clarification from @WhiteHouse physician on 72 hours from diagnosis statement.
How can this have been handled so clumsily?
Really astonishing
So why not just say?
This is the extraordinary letter released by @realDonaldTrump physician pre-2016 election, suggesting that Mr Trump might have had a hand in writing it.
Not inconceivable that president has told his physician today what he could and couldn‚Äôt say over receiving oxygen
Unbelievable - so the 'source' for the statement that president's vitals being 'very concerning' 
I'm going to guess is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff - seen here briefing my colleagues, straight after the press conference by @realDonaldTrump  physician
In the name of openness and transparency, please @WhiteHouse @PressSec answer these two questions:
When was @realDonaldTrump first diagnosed with #coronavirus, or when was last negative result?
Has the president received supplemental oxygen?
This needs clarifying
This is crazy.
Very important addition to this.
This is a senior WH ‚Äòsource‚Äô who has said this to ALL the pool reporters who are at Walter Reed.
So at same time as dr is saying one thing, a senior official is painting a v different picture.
Why would you do that?
This is a very different picture than one painted by @realDonaldTrump physician 
During the 72 hour timeline given by physician, @realDonaldTrump held a press briefing with no mask, flew to Duluth for rally, went to Bedminster for a fund raiser where no one wore masks.
If @WhiteHouse knew he was symptomatic/had #coronavirus isn‚Äôt that indefensible?
My big take out from that briefing - the physician talked about the last 72 hours.
What?
Confirmation only came yesterday morning from @realDonaldTrump
 - so did he have #coronavirus on Wednesday, and WH chose not to disclose it?
 Seems a fair question
#SeanConley 
the physician to @realDonaldTrump is giving a lawyer‚Äôs answers about being given oxygen, not a doctor‚Äôs....
‚ÄòHe‚Äôs not received any Oxygen today,‚Äô says @realDonaldTrump physician - but yesterday?
He seemed to deflect that answer
#SeanConley says we‚Äôre ‚Äòextremely pleased‚Äô at progress @realDonaldTrump is making
State of the art monitoring was reason to go to Walter Reed says @realDonaldTrump physician.
BreKing: ‚Äòthe president is doing very well‚Äô says his physician Sean. Inlet
Are we the super-gifted younger brother?
I don‚Äôt think so.
Briefings often run late.
But on something so important, why announce a time and then not stick to it
This....
Ha Aileen.
I would post a selfie, but I look so bloody ragged....
Useful reminder from @BarackObama.
And it needs saying: 
‚ÄúObviously, we‚Äôre in the midst of a big political battle right now, and while there‚Äôs a lot at stake, let‚Äôs remember that we‚Äôre all Americans.
We‚Äôre all human beings.
And we want everyone to be healthy, no matter our party."
Just confirmed - Update on @realDonaldTrump health will be given by his physician Sean Conley in an hour‚Äôs time
Spectacular
Add Republican Senator Ron Johnson
About the #SuperSpreader #SCOTUS event last Saturday at the @WhiteHouse, best comment 
I‚Äôve read is that it‚Äôs made Democrats believe in God, and Republicans believe in science....
Thanks Matt...
Add to that Chris Christie - just confirmed as well
None!
You‚Äôre very kind.
What a week....
In last 24 hours as well as @realDonaldTrump  &amp; FLOTUS we've had positive tests on:
2 republican senators
Kellyanne Conway
Trump campaign manager
Head of RNC
3 WH correspondents
This hasn't happened at some overcrowded meat packing plant, but the WH where they've been cavalier
President receiving Remdesivir - but not requiring supplemental oxygen, according to latest bulletin from WH physician
President walking from the White House unaided on his way to helicopter to take him to #WalterReed Medical Centre
Very important point - @WhiteHouse is stressing that @realDonaldTrump going to #WalterReed will not involve temp transfer of power to @VP, as per Article 25 of the constitution.
‚ÄòThe President remains in charge‚Äô is the message
üëç
BREAKING.
@realDonaldTrump about to be flown from White House to Walter Reed Medical Centre ‚Äòas a precaution‚Äô.
This has strong echoes of the trajectory @BorisJohnson - precautionary move etc
Our latest #Americast on a dramatic and troubling 18 hours 
#coronavirus 
#TrumpHasCovid
BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump chief of staff, Mark Meadows, says president is showing mild symptoms of #coronavirus, but is in good spirits
All events have been cleared from @realDonaldTrump schedule - except this one:
He is going ahead with a conference call on #coronavirus and how it affects vulnerable seniors.....
Really
First comment from Biden: LINK 
Oh piss off you clown.
And it‚Äôs through.
Not trough
An historical document, and only an hour or two old.
The confirmation of @realDonaldTrump diagnosis from White House physician of #coronavirus
02.00 and  woken by Bureau Chief with news that @realDonaldTrump has #coronavirus - which is simultaneous stonishing - given all the testing.
And not at all surprising, given blas√© attitudes towards mask wearing in the White House.
Wishing the POTUS, FLOTUS and Hope well
This is sadly ironic
So what does this mean?
Are all rallies canceled?
Does he quarantine for two weeks - all the time you could be incubating the virus?
If so, that means there won‚Äôt be a second #PresidentialDebate2020 in Florida.
BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump says "I just went for a test and we'll see what happens." 
He is awaiting results for coronavirus test after close aide, Hope Hicks who travelled on Marine One and AF1 with POTUS yesterday tests positive.
Says he doesn't know yet about self-quarantining
48 hours after creating a firestorm over refusing to condemn white supremacists #ProudBoys, and after the far right group used the president's words as a recruiting and marketing tool, @realDonaldTrump goes on #Hannity on #Fox to say this
So Saturday we had #AmyConeyBarrett  
Sunday the New York Times @realDonaldTrump  tax bombshell, 
Monday the aftermath, 
Tuesday the #PresidentialDebate, 
Wednesday #ProudBoy-gate, 
Now this...just another quiet 5 days in #TrumpLand 
Apologies if I've missed anything
üëÄ
I think that‚Äôs an unfair question to ask Mr Zurcher - he won‚Äôt know who Noel Edmonds is.
And he probably thinks crinkly bottom is something you treat with a soothing cream....
Don't wish to be harsh - but wasn't everyone a loser in this debate - particularly American democracy?
The idea that there is any talk of winning 'big' after Tuesday's car crash  might be seen as a bit tone deaf #PresidentialDebate2020
Thanks Joe...
Sue main thing is you don‚Äôt have to watch it.
It‚Äôs a podcast.
But never mind.
Have a nice day
I know sounds logical.
But what if @realDonaldTrump campaign don‚Äôt agree - and feel pretty certain they won‚Äôt.
The president doesn‚Äôt want it to be sedate
You‚Äôd expect me to say this...but I think this is a really good listen.
And interviews with a couple of undecided voters post debate are super interesting....
if you haven‚Äôt subscribed do join us @maitlis and @awzurcher
Brilliant!
Breaking - statement from Debates Commission on last night‚Äôs shitshow, and calling for further measures to ensure orderly #Debates2020 - but new measures meaningless unless candidates adhere
And thanks Gordon!
 Hope you enjoy new episode which should be up soon
Good question.
Yes he does have to pay for it if it‚Äôs purely a campaign stop.
But obviously advantageous to have AF1 as your backdrop when you rock up for a rally in an aircraft hangar
Cos I‚Äôm in Ohio for debate, and Arizona is a bit of a schlep for a vox pop
they were interesting.
A lot said Biden had done way better than they‚Äôd expected.
Hadn‚Äôt anticipated Trump supporters would say that.
Campaign set bar so low for him that he jumped it easily
This was biggest Trump ‚Äòwatch party‚Äô in Ohio last night in a town called Strongsville (sic) - and moment I walk in with my mask on, a guy comes up (not in photo), and says to me ‚Äòyou loser,‚Äô pointing at the mask. ü§∑‚Äç
#PresidentialDebate2020 
#debates
Hmm...
üò¨
The morning after the night before.
#ChrisWallace is taking a kicking from liberal media for not being tough enough with @realDonaldTrump, and from the right for being in the pocket of the Dems.
Seems unfair on both counts.
#NoWin  
#Debates2020 
#PresidentialDebate2020
You do realise the Proud Boys have now changed their logo to incorporate the president's words?
They are saying it was an historic night for them thanks to @realDonaldTrump, and are boasting of new recruits as a result.
You clearly don't watch much Fox...
Fox and Friends?
Tucker? Judge Jeanne? Hannity? 
Do I need to go on.....
This....
Tune in to #Americast later today where @maitlis @awzurcher and I will try to make sense of the first #PresidentialDebate2020 
#debates
This was @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs best moment of the night
 #debates #PresidentialDebate2020
ü§î
Have just returned from a bar fifteen miles outside Cleveland at a watch party where there were about a 1000 @realDonaldTrump supporters.
Surprising take out?
Grudging acknowledgement @JoeBiden had done better than they‚Äôd expected.
#debates 
#PresidentialDebate2020
This is a straightforward challenge to @nytimes reporting - the paper says @realDonaldTrump paid  $750 in 2016 and 2017 in federal income tax.
The president says he paid millions
Let‚Äôs see documents 
#PresidentialDebate 
#Debates2020
One thing for the president to go after a CNN or MSNBC presenter, but a Fox anchor
#Debates2020 
#PresidentialDebate2020
‚ÄúWill you shut up, man?‚Äù Says @JoeBiden exasperated at the constant heckling from @realDonaldTrump 
- can this level of talking over each other continue for next 70 minutes?
I think I know the answer #Debates2020
@JoeBiden needs to stop laughing derisively, @realDonaldTrump needs to stop snarling, particularly at host
#Debates2020
This is like start of FA Cup final before they sing Abide With Me - all nerves and anticipation #PresidentialDebate2020
I think premature evacuation of your pending mail...
And again....
Fabulous light in #Cleveland ahead of #PresidentialDebate2020
üòâ
Yikes....
Yeah but you can never be sure when  there‚Äôs a 95th minute penalty awarded #COYS üôÑ
When a hospital becomes a military base.
The scene in #Cleveland ahead of tonight‚Äôs  #PresidentialDebate2020
Yes we‚Äôve reported on claims of that.
Georgia???!!! üòØ
Can that be true???
Is this boxing‚Äôs equivalent of the weigh-in trash talking?
#PresidentialDebate2020
Who needs sleep?
Stay up and watch...and maybe invite all your friends over.
Oh hang on.
Scratch the last bit
Hang on.
This is problematic.
Last night: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs totally fake news.
Made up.
Fake.‚Äù
Today: ‚Äúillegally obtained information‚Äù
Which is it?
This is why the @nytimes #DonaldTrumpTaxes story might well resonate - it is not some call with a Ukrainian leader about military aid  and investigations into an obscure gas company.
This is very easy to understand to anyone who pays income tax in the US
But will it make a difference....?
But of course...
#2020worstyear 
Incredible @nytimes story.
The year @realDonaldTrump became president and was listed as a billionaire by Forbes he paid just $750 in income tax.
And killer line from report: ‚ÄòTrump has been more successful playing a business mogul than being one in real life‚Äô
My report tonight on #SCOTUS 
- Joe Biden says Supreme Court nomination is a ‚Äúthreat to democracy‚Äù
This is amazing.
Well worth finding the time for.
Blood Lands is bloody fantastic 
This really does boggle the mind: that in the midst of a deadly pandemic, protestors are clashing with police - over the pandemic - resulting in injuries on both sides
Sorry.
Still gives me shivers.....
Good summary, if you want a quick digest of where #AmyConeyBarrett stands on the big issues
#SCOTUS 
The 'compare and contrast' quotes from Lindsey Graham really are quite something
So awful and so shocking.
And thank goodness it is so shocking.
Sadly here in the US, police being shot - or police shooting suspects - is an everyday occurrence.
Looking forward to it (he smiles nervously...) 
So not from Queens, New York then? ü§î 
Ouch.
I think latest @foxnewsalert polls are not going to go down well at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 
Great work from Donie at CNN  what price facts?
what price truth? 
You probably know this, but our latest pod is up.
Would love to hear your views on the two congressional candidates @maitlis and I interview - one Republican, one Democrat.
Also latest on #RBG 
A reminder from a different time and a different century.
He won‚Äôt have liked this - not one little bit.
#RBG 
No wonder @realDonaldTrump wants to get ride of this FBI Director as well...he just doesn‚Äôt get the narrative.
Whoa.
Just now from @realDonaldTrump on #MeghanMarkle -  "I'm not a fan of hers, and  would say this....I wish a lot of luck to Harry, because he's gonna need it.‚Äù
I do hope we didn‚Äôt swear.
Sorry, but isn‚Äôt it a bit Dad‚Äôs Army to have to stop and do your shoe laces up?
Wonder whether he‚Äôs Private Pike.
It‚Äôs tightening.
But not a whole lot of social distancing.
Oh @maitlis - that is joyous!
 Thank the lord he wasn‚Äôt in Kent 
This is where it is deeply uncomfortable: 
Total US deaths = 200k. 
Global deaths =965k. 
US deaths represent 20%. plus plus of total US share of world population = 4%.
Therefore 5x more deaths relative to pop'n.
How is that an A+?
