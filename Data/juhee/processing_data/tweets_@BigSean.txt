Yessir! It takes 4-6 weeks (says that on the site too). To press up n make fresh. 
I definitely wanted it to be done that way as opposed to just sitting around prior. 
It feels better and it’s cleaner n safer when it’s made 4 you, pressed up n shipped directly to you! 
More time tho
On God 🤞🏾
I hope this not real
Yup
It says 4 to 6 weeks on the site 😒.
I wanted them to print the merch fresh instead of having it sitting around.
It’s better when it’s made n pressed n shipped to you directly for you n also more sanitary.
Takes longer, but It’s better n safer that way  🤞🏾🌍🚀✊🏾🌹

Lack of communication and wrong information from people fueled by the ego is like mixing flames wit diesel...
