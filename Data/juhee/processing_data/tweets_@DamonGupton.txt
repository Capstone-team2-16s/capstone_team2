Unbelievable
Thomas Jefferson Byrd.
My God.
What the hell.
Wow.
This is awful news.
Yeah man
Didn’t know where you grew up cat, and not sure what you mean about my objectives.
Truth be told, had no idea Hartford loyalty swung to the Patriots.
Good to know, cuz I truly personally didn’t know any lifelong Patriots fans outside of my gf and her folks.
Amen
Sorry about Cam by the way.
I was looking forward to that game today.
Ahhhhh.
Good to know.
Always or when they got good?
My gf is from Boston, so she’s both suffered and triumphed
Yup.
They have earned nothing from me.
I’m a Cowboys “victim” too, lol
Can you help me get this to Jerry?
Dear Jerry Jones: For the sake of the lifelong love and loyalty I’ve had with the Dallas Cowboys, please let all your team kneel and take that knee, because they are in serious need of some prayer right now.
#Cowboys
I do agree.
It’s a shame.
😂😂😂 Youre kidding right...they aren’t exactly top of the food chain right now are they?
Props on that one super bowl year with Foles...but it’s been rough over there.
#never
My request to Jerry:
Dear Jerry Jones: For the sake of the lifelong love and loyalty I’ve had with the Dallas Cowboys, please let all your team kneel and take that knee, because they are in serious need of some prayer right now.
#Cowboys
Yeah.
Did the tour too.
Been waiting for them to EARN my right to purchase tickets and see my first home game there.
Dear Jerry Jones: For the sake of the lifelong love and loyalty I’ve had with the Dallas Cowboys, please let all your team kneel and take that knee, because they are in serious need of some prayer right now.
#Cowboys
Yup.
No change upstairs, no change downstairs.
No identity.
No mental toughness.
Embarrassment upon embarrassment.
Yeah.
It’s rough.
They’re cursed.
Jerry’s cursed.
I’ve held out hope to see them in the NFC Championship game or the Super Bowl again in my lifetime, but I don’t have high hopes.
You a Rams fan?
He can kiss my...
Amen
No words for how bad and idiotic the Cowboys are right now.
All this skill and yet all this incompetence.
And you all have the nerve to think you earn my lifelong fandom.
Tired of you needing a miracle, get some damn results and execute.
Pathetic.
If only the ‘Boys could play real defense ☹️
Oh...
Daryl Worley is on Odell Beckham Jr....
I can sleep well now 🙄 
#Cowboys
Yup
True
He betta KEEP playing...cuz lord knows my boys have NO defense
I’m glad this cat ain’t my doctor.
Wow.

This is true
This is awesome
I don’t know man.
You have to ask them.
Appreciate the luv though.

Most energy and resolve he’s had in awhile, to me
Unreal.
Smdh.
Amen
They seem to be trying very hard.
I feel like Don Lemon is really trying hard not to break out laughing.
Lol
Utter and disgraceful evil.
Been disgusted by this all day.
It’s so blatant and clear and unjust.
I dont know how these people sleep at night knowing they are cheaters.
Fact about the bs Abbott pulled in Texas today.
Important
I’m still so disgusted the Clippers kicked him out like that.
Always will be.
Yup. 
Been seething and posting about this all day.
Losers and cheaters.
Bravo man
Evil, cheating, cowardly, scared bastards.
This is beyond ridiculous. 
Alright now Chapman, dammit, I wasn’t ready to be shedding tears yet today ❤️
I hear you
Fantastic 🙏
Lol. 
Yeah man. 
Madness.
Always
I just bought this a few weeks ago.
Freddie 🙏
Doc was worth more than that.
He definitely should have gotten another year to build on.
And who do you get now that will lead like that?
My fear is that the team will fall apart completely now.
That’s exactly what I told my girlfriend.
She thought they would fire him.
She was right.
I still can’t believe it.
A pandemic, injuries, lack of playing time, the bubble, Lou’s chicken wings, Trez’s grandmothers death, load management, PG’s depression, racism and boycotts...
I love this woman.
My heart hurts for Doc.
Dude was class
These are facts.
It happened.
Amen
I woke up resolved.
Again.
🙏
Amen
Amen
Sheer and utter.
Clarification...for those who need it...which ain’t many of us most likely

Can’t love this enough.
YESSIR! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏

Must. See. TV.
Nah.
I’m good.
Unforgivable
Lol
Right?!
Yup
Amen. 🙏
Insane.
Wow, lol. Priceless.
Yup
Amen

Amen
“Stand back and stand by.” You heard those words. 
They will be remembered.
That’s so kind.
This “debate” is an embarrassment eh?
Agreed
I dig it
Agreed.
Packing now.
This LINK 
Yes indeedy

Yup
This is easily one of the worst things I’ve ever seen.
Disaster
Amen
Amen
Very kind of you.
Thank you.
GREAT spot on MSNBC today man.
Hope you and yours are well.
Lol, yes.
It was nice to see him again, especially on a project of this magnitude.
Hope you and yours are well in the storms.
This broke my heart today.
We love you coach and can’t stand this news.
You deserved better.
This was not a normal year, this is not a normal time, and you are not just some normal coach.
This one stings bad.
Amen.
Saddened to hear this news.
Doc Rivers deserved better than that.
Wow.
He deserved at least another year given what 2020 was.
Cold game.
#Clippers
My floodgates have opened
Tonight. We premiere. On Showtime. 
#TheComeyRule 
The Texas Tech coaching staff from the 2pt conversion thru overtime have left me scratching my head...for eternity.
Those poor players.
And I’m not even a fan of the team.
Poor fellas.
Evil 
Hey @RatchedNetflix, give Bernard Herrmann his props.
Dude’s a genius.
Looking for him in the credits. 😊 
#CapeFear  
#RatchedNetflix
Finally starting Ratched and I can’t help be but transported to the brilliance of both Scorcese’s and the original CAPE FEAR thanks to the inimitable music of the great Bernard Herrmann.
Can’t hear that music without thinking that boat sequence and my man DeNiro.
#RatchedNetflix 
So cool.
I’ve had the pleasure of working for both these fine gents.
This is amazing. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 to the legendary and talented @VirgilWilliams and @BillyRay5229.
That’s some high praise right there.
We premiere Sunday.
Tune in.
#TheComeyRule 
Enough.
Said. 
We air Sunday and Monday 
Look at this mess.
Vote. In. Person. And even after then...pray. 
We need more of THIS Fauci.
Play to win the game. 
Ridiculous 
Ridiculous 
What the hell.
🙏
I cannot agree with this more. Fabulous actress. Ease.
No offense to any talented artist/winner, but Shira Haas deserved to win that Emmy last night.
Her performance in Unorthodox was truly incredible.
HOW ‘BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!! 
#EpicComeback 
#Cowboys 
This.
Good read.
Keep hope alive.
Timely.
Right after that lovely earthquake too.
Earthquake.
Nice good one.
What a day.
This is a great and sobering thread, with a call to arms.
Absolutely.
And may many more choose the side of GOOD vs. evil.
This is a beautiful summoning of courage to dig deeper.
Yes

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Damn.
2020 continues to claim some true warriors for justice. Salute. Damn. 🙏

But...out of curiosity, if “we’ve done more for Puerto Rico than anybody”, didn’t Puerto Rico deserve this kind of response THREE YEARS AGO.
It’s been three years.
I mean, I know you’ve got to  win Florida but come on.
That’s cold.
Damn I love football.
This was so kind.
It always touches me how supportive fans can be.
And when you unexpectedly get kicked to the curb from a project, it’s unsettling, so people’s generosity and enthusiasm for your work mean the world.
The appreciation is not lost on me.
Back at you all.
Always🙏
Honored to be a part.
Watch us Sept. 27 and 28.
The sequels are playing out right before our very eyes.
Yes.👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 
On a side note from all the world’s obvious madness, one thing is surprisingly sure for me...
@CobraKaiSeries is everything.
The sentimental 80’s kid and perennial nerd in me are waxing on and off giddily on Cloud 9 🙏

Heart busted wide open.
Wow.
Smdh 
Love it 
Stanley Crouch.
Wow.
Rest In Peace. 🙏
That is extraordinary grace and restraint to leave this woman alone after this.
Wow. 🙏
