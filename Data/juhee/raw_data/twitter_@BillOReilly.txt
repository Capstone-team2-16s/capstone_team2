Again, be VERY skeptical of what the corporate media is reporting about the President’s medical condition.

Both pro and anti-Trump forces are trying to control the narrative.

Truth has nothing to do with it.

Keep dialed into http://BillOReilly.com.

Brand new column just posted.

Subject: what will happen to us if Democrats win in November.

Hope you read it.

Special Message of the Day about President Trump’s Covid condition posted on http://BillOReilly.com.

Important you read it.

President Trump’s Doctor just said he’s doing “very well.”  But the hysterical corporate media is not.

Honest reporting on http://BillOReilly.com.

Caution on believing what the press is reporting about President Trump.

Remember, there are no rules of journalism anymore.

These people will put rumor and falsehood out there.

http://BillOReilly.com is monitoring closely.

The most important issue of this election is the Supreme Court – politicizing the court is a danger to our rights.

Biden/Harris still refusing to answer whether they would pack the Supreme Court – a non-answer is an answer.

Packing the court is the single most important issue in this election.

If you feel glad that Donald and Melania Trump are ill, then you have a sickness, too.

And while most recover from Covid, the disease of enjoying the suffering of others is rarely defeated.

That disease is called evil.

Tons of propaganda on TV news today.

I cannot endure it.
 
Please check out my debate analysis.

Fair and smart.

Or am I wrong?

Very important show tonight—we are live directly following the first presidential debate.

I’ll have my full analysis of the event, open to all.
Watch the special @NoSpinNews on http://TheFirstTV.com or http://BillOReilly.com.

I’m live now on https://t.co/JwHUbSJ0rb analyzing that disappointment of a debate.

Big mistake.


Biden says officials in Portland and Oregon could take care of violence if Trump would stay out of it.

Major gaffe.

Biden wants community policing where mental health people accompany the cops on 911 calls.
Biden is coming across soft on crime.

Every time Trump directs a question to him about what he would do—he dodges.
Trump scores points on law and order.
Biden has no reply to his silence about the violence in the demonstrations and in criminal matters.

Joe Biden is not telling the truth about the Charlottesville, Virginia remarks on “very fine people on both sides”.

The debate over the statue removals was the context of Trump’s remarks.

Joe Biden is absolutely lying about this.

Biden just called President Trump a clown.

Chris Wallace doesn’t have the facts at his command about the Ukraine payments made to Biden’s son that Trump brought up.

Big mistake by Mr. Wallace.

Biden says Trump blew it because the Obama administration handed him a vibrant economy.

Not sure Americans will buy that.
Trump does not answer the question about $750 paid in personal federal income tax.
Wallace pushing Trump to answer the federal income tax figure at $750.
Trump says Biden wants to shutdown the economy—points to Democratic states that are keeping businesses closed.

Strong argument.
Biden scoring some points on Covid.

President Trump should ask Biden why he said Trump was xenophobic when he stopped flights from China.

That is a strong point, but Trump is not following up fast enough.

Wallace’s questions are too long.
Both guys are boring on the never-ending health care thing.
Biden calls Trump a liar, Trump lets it go.
Good line from Trump—he tells Chris Wallace he’s debating him, not Joe.
Trump being very aggressive in contradicting what Biden says.

First 7 minutes—Trump stronger.
Biden stumbling over first question about Amy Coney Barrett and whether she should be nominated.

Two lock predictions for tonight’s debate.

Joe Biden will say “if in fact” at least 15 times.

And the live debate analysis on http://BillOReilly.com/live immediately after the chat fest, will be fair and smart!
 
See you later.

Just moments after the debate concludes we are LIVE with the best analysis anywhere!
 
No use trying to get info out of the pinheads on cable news.

Please spread the word.

Biden-Harris releasing their tax returns is a smart move and President Trump will be asked about his taxes tonight.

Might be first question.

I’ll be on live right after debate.

No BS!


Smart, fair, and tough analysis LIVE immediately following tonight's debate.

http://BillOReilly.com has it.

@TheFirstonTV has it.

@77WABCradio radio has it.

The networks and their pinhead panels do not have it.
