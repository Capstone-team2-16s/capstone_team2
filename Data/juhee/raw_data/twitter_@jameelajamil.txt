I didn’t. News articles started popping up about it with false information, so I looked... and boom. 
My tweet was gone.


But I bet I told you they are you babe marks and cool because they’re a sign you’re taking up space! which is GOOD. 
I have them everywhere. 
But screen grab this. 
Incase I wipe/ delete my account!
Hi. No specific tweets have been deleted. 
My whole Twitter was wiped in July this year when I handed my Twitter over to only being for my podcast and young activists for a few months while I took time off to write. 
You can check for yourself. ❤️
Hi love been spreading info for 3 days on my Instagram x
Busy Philips episode out now! 
Busy Phillips episode out now 
Quibi failed. 
Netflix is thriving.
It amazes me how often people forget that perhaps it’s the way our country/world TREATS trans people that makes them unhappy, rather than being trans itself. 
You’re too ignorant to even respect HIS gender after HIS death. 
You’re the problem. 
You’re the sickness.
It’s like a chef only cooking their one Favourite dish otherwise. 
The restaurant would close down.
I don’t make the rules. 🤷🏽‍♀️ 
My puppy was on the cover of Harpers Bazaar. 
I was also there but who the fuck cares? It’s a PUPPY. 
Did 5 members of Pence’s team really test positive for covid or does the administration just want us to forget that a Melania decoy was used today? 🤔
She’s going to win the whole series. An angel. 
Ha they were the default on the page. 
I don’t know how much I weigh so I wouldn’t be able to even answer it!
Hey I’m specifically talking about Net-a-Porter and Mr Porter in the tweet as is fairly clear I think.
🤣
Not on the male version of this site...
I am so sick of women’s sizing. 
Men get clear inches/cm, and we get asked what we WEIGH?! 
As if weight indicates definitive size or shape. 
Hey @NETAPORTER I think this is an inappropriate and frankly  unscientific way to “help” a woman find her size. 
@MRPORTERLIVE doesn’t do this
Yep everyone has xx
❤️
Hey guys I can point you in the direction of some excellent Black activists and social commentators who will be far more valuable here than I would be. ❤️
❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
Ah ❤️
Angel!
Progress not perfection. 
We are all learning. 
Even if some pretend they have no further knowledge to gain.
Last day you can vote for me for the E people’s choice award for best podcast. 
I’m also nominated for best comedy star, but I’m up against Issa Rae, so don’t bother because she is god.
What is going on? in 2020?! 
Why are we seeing reproductive rights roll back this fast? 
This is in Poland, and it’s coming to the US IF YOU DON’T BLOODY VOTE.

She doesn’t know! 
She was just born that way. 
She wishes she was cooler. 
But she never will be!
Every time. Every single time.

Anyone know how much of TiKToks revenue comes from selling diet products? 
(They are seemingly directed mostly at women...)
I am reposting his now deleted tweet not to cause him grief, and please know he has apologized, But it’s important for context to my response. He is not the first, nor will he be the last to think it’s funny or clever to diminish my work.
Hello mate, wrote this for you and your flustered friends to merely consider mid-eye roll. 👍🏽 
So cool!
Not at all. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It’s not this specific thing, it’s just an endless wave of it. 
Do they want to just tell all women not to bother unless they are perfect and fully educated? 
Is that the road to mass progress or should we encourage everyone to scrap in and help and champion actually TRYING?
My feelings are not hurt, I know I’m an easy punchline for clicks, and am more than accustomed to it, but to reduce my inclusion to a meme, is hilarious. 
Amazing
Without downloading new pics where are you mentally? 
So proud of this series we made @i_weigh big LOVE to @jamie_windust @tomallencomedy and @sojen10 ❤️
Please vote. Please. 
I know you don’t want either butThis is a humanitarian crisis CAUSED and maintained by the current administration. 
They have to go.
The Jokers and I are back for more hilariously cringey fun on #TheMiseryIndex and we're really taking things up a notch Don't miss an all-new episode tonight at 10:30/9:30c on @TBSNetwork
A young person called Courtney Birch painted me onto a skateboard and I think that’s cool. 👍🏽 
This is how my dog sleeps. 
(The little paw protectively covering his dick while he lays like a fancy porn star.) 
This is a very extreme reaction to me asking you to be on my podcast... 😂
Who did? I will beat them.
Two legends.
The best.
Ah the old dj days. I miss them!
My new second character in #DuckTales is revealed. 
Getting to play good and evil is so fun. 
I am so lucky to be a part of this show. 
Coming sooon

This is so troubling. ❤️ 
Lol
A pic of us Getting ready for the Cambridge Union address today. 
So sad to have not been there in person but I’m thankful that you had me, and the questions were all fantastic and thoughtful. ❤️ 
I spoke to the stunningly wonderful @jilly_peppa on my podcast about her life, her lessons and all of the things she wants the world to understand about disabled people. 
She taught me so much, and was so fun and honest and we had such an open dialogue devoid of stigma and taboo.
Shhhhhhhhhhhh
I live with this man. 👌🏽👌🏽
Bloody wow 🤩 


👍🏽
I’m talking about the shocking number of cases. 
Not the cinemas opening. 
You went in deep with that presumption. 
Just ask next time dude.
It’s on the trans community, not me, or any cis people, to accept an apology and meaningful growth from her, and if they did, so would I.
They are so in love. 
Anyone else only ever cut their fringe/bangs when they’re hormonal and angry and feeling chaotic? 
And then it’s cut badly and you have to keep fixing it until it’s too short and you look like a baby lamb? (Cries in PMS.)
Ahahahaha you’re cute x
No I want the specific moment acknowledged
Well. 
If there was an Emmy for a facial expression 
I’m saying their stans alone are worth stanning! 
I Stan their stans.
Both suits me. 
Iconic is iconic.
Namjoon. ❤️
Can’t decide if I Stan BTS or BTS stans themselves more. 
Their power to disrupt is 💪🏽 ❤️
I - https://t.co/r5aMcYEUDj
Yes but it has never felt like enough. And now I know why.
Tom. This is so nice. 
Have you been hacked? 😇
Did not know this was a thing. 
I love America. 
The incel cries in anonymous.
Beach *Boy*. 
Only Mike Love is playing. 
Best rapper in the world right now.
The most depressing thing is watching women expect perfection from themselves and attempt to cancel themselves upon error. 
This is taught to us by our misogynist conditioning
Expecting perfection from a woman is patriarchy. 
Expecting her to go away and shut up upon (innocent) mistakes is patriarchy. 
We allow men to grow and edit and champion them when they do, women must be afforded the same luxury of a capacity for evolution. ❤️
I miss Ted. 
Stupid fucking pandemic. 
🤔
Secret same. 
But I acknowledge it’s hustle.
Goodbye Milky Way old friend. 
You never really developed an identity. 
You were always just the runt to the mighty Mars bar.
He’ll tell you he hasn’t changed since moving from Camberwell to LA but... 
VOTE EARLY FOR FUCK’S SAKE.
This song was premiered by @AnnieMac last week on @BBCR1 and I can’t stop listening. 
What the FUCK?
Chopsdicks
There are some people who tweet me to tell me to shut up. 
Would it not be easier to just mute my name rather than hate-follow? 
I am unable to circulate my own words, it’s not my fault if your friends/favorite publications do. 
Be an adult and just block or mute me for peace.❤️
That’s not it at all. 
Just shows how repulsed people are by age and wrinkles my even referring to them  makes you think 
I’m insulting  someone when actually I’m literally saying it’s so cool 
I wish women were allowed to show ours rather than be airbrushed.
Stop flaunting your clown privilege.
Obsessed.
Nobody was saying there was. 
It’s a viral meme that people  are doing to show “then” and “now” it’s not a joke about oppression. 
You need to think. And then tweet
Always corn flakes.
Pub garden?
So go home from the packed pub at 10pm alone. 
Where is the joke about getting fat? 
Its about being dressed up at fancy events vs living in sweats eating on the floor like teenagers. 
You reached, and you missed.
@Brexit83 Relative suffering doesn’t impact the reality of mass societal stigma.
Whether you’re walking out of your mansion or your council estate flat. 
Stormzy was reported entering his own expensive flat in west London wearing a designer suit...
For the last time...
Did doctors refuse to diagnose you because of your size? 
Did employers not hire you because you looked “unhealthy and lazy”? 
Did you manage to find clothes that fit you in most stores? Is it culturally more acceptable to be thin or fat? 
Are mostly thin or fat people in magazines?
White Privilege isn’t about money, it’s the ABSENCE of RACIAL  discrimination. 
How do people still not understand this? 
Thin privilege doesn’t mean thin people have money, it means they aren’t subjected to constant societal weight based stigma/bullying/harassment.
This means you think wrinkles are bad... I think he looks great and want similar images of women.
He looks great
She was great
Hello! 
If you like my @i_weigh podcast, today you can vote for the @peopleschoice award here: today votes count as twice as much. 😇
😍
Omg 
Also wrinkles are hot. 
Men’s wrinkles are hot. 
This picture is sexier and cooler for how human it looks. 
When will we see a woman’s wrinkles as hot rather than a sign she has “expired.”
Interesting wording. 
Making her sound like the instigator when he is the one who is married and significantly older and putting all the moves on in the pictures and took his wedding ring off. 
And predictably, today she is getting all the shit online because we always blame women.
NBC is going to the Bad Place. 👎🏽
Lol no never- I think it’s hot, I want it to be hot for women too!
I would look to the work of  @yrfatfriend she is an absolute legend and so so informed on the subject.
There is a debate? about body shaming?
The lows we have stooped to when we are bullying an 18 year old pop star about her body, forgetting that not only is she human, but there are children watching our behavior internalizing our words against themselves and others, learning from you how to make this world uglier.

Ladies. 
Every time you find yourself looking in a mirror and despairing of your (great natural) lines, just remember you only notice and hate them because a bunch of men in media decided to never let older women show their natural age on magazine covers and on screen. 
It’s a con.
I really hope when I’m older, if I’m on a magazine cover they keep my wrinkles in the way they do for men. 
Tired of seeing older women being airbrushed to look like emojis, setting up weird and offensive ideals for women who are the same age. 
This is human. 
This is cool. 👇🏽 https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1316363376268922882
I mean...
Story was a fake 💔
Can we name any male comedians singled out for apparently being too fat to play someone without money? 
Do we always single male comedians out for not being thin enough to play someone without money? 
Also just FYI due to genetics/inability to afford nutritious food/work leaving no time to exercise/stress... etc... no money doesn’t always = thin. 🤷🏽‍♀️🤡
Question! 
Why does John Dugdale at @thesundaytimes need to write something so wreckless my callous and fatphobic about @Kathbum and Jessica Barden? 
It’s 2020. 
He’s the man who astoundingly accused the RSC of being “garishly diverse” back in 2018. 
Why pay for his archaic opinion?
😭
Mate I lived on potato smiley faces and bread and had no time between jobs to fit in a work out. 
But mostly why is this even an issue in a comedy review?!
Lol so early
Mood
Enjoying this so much.


I will not post any more burgers...
Also crossroads is damn fine
Good lord delicious vegan fast food?! #montysgoodburgerLA (I’m vegan 5 days a week.) 👍🏽 
No. As I don’t date people who take cocaine. 
But I will be friends with them. 
But dating is different.
Yep we are still friends. 😬

Just to be clear this man did not have any kind of health related fit, for some reason they edited out the part where I say it turned out he’d secretly taken a cocktail (no pun intended) of cocaine and viagra before our date. 
Thus the fit and the surprise erection. 👍

This is gonna be so gooooooood. 
This was the most amazing month in the studio. 
I love you. Lol.
Well Lucas Bravo is having a good week.

Mate! Congrats.
How it started.        
How it’s going. 
A genius
Or “Patriotism”
This is terrorism. 
Is it being called terrorism? 
Or would they have to have dark skin? 
Maaaaate ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
😂
Mate!!!
Just trying to bring some excitement to your day!
Unbelievable ❤️

If you are actually pro-life... then vote blue. 
To vote red is just to be pro-birth. 
Once you’re out of the womb, you’re on your own. They don’t even want you to have healthcare.

I 


This is 👌🏽

It is hilarious to be nominated in a list of all my Favourite people.

Thanks @peopleschoice for making my inner child LOL at this.


The desperation for a hot take here  is cute.
This is one of the cutest of these so far.

My boyfriend‘s voice singing over all these family hugging vids is 🥰 even to my cold English heart.

👍🏽

Welp.

If ya don’t ask, ya don’t get.

The most British and enjoyable Sunday read.

I am forever obsessed with him.

😂 

Lol fuck off

#NewProfilePic


Found someone to laugh with every day for 6 years. 👍🏽

#NationalBoyfriendDay

*pretends to be shocked.* 

EXACTLY

You don’t have to kick a guy about his health to just point out what makes him an inappropriate candidate.

I am encouraged by a reality tv star who lost his father’s money 5 times and hasn’t paid taxes for 15 years becoming the president.

There are no rules!


Turning the other cheek is not going to win this election.

It’s like fighting fire with lube...… 

Keep. Going. 
❤️ also well done 

😶

Hoping this excitement has made your night hun.

#dreambig ❤️

Maybe there you will have the courage to show your real name and picture?

#goals

Yeah I’m not exactly dying to meet you either.

Don’t, even for a second, take your eyes off his taxes, his Proud Boys signal, his refusal to denounce white supremacy, or the replacement of RBG which threatens reproductive rights.

Nobody is talking about his taxes or his white supremacy slip.
Well. Nobody is talking about his taxes anymore...

What Chrissy has done is fucking brave and admirable.

Miscarriage should not be a taboo subject.

She is helping normalize this delicate and important and very, very needed conversation.

It was massively generous to choose to be so open in this moment.

Celiac Twitter, when you accidentally eat gluten what do you do?
😇

I am.

Glitter is a fantastic work of art with an amazing soundtrack.

Sue me.

LOL.

That is Rihanna.

I could NEVER.

She is 😍

#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽

Ahahahahaha

I thought the same.
But I have to say...

I just tried it... and I don’t hate it. 
I actually liked it. 
So I cancel myself.
Goodbye.

Update: it’s surprisingly good

The most 2020 looking pizza turned up tonight.

But ya know what they say... pizza is like sex, when it’s good it’s really good, and when it’s bad... 
it’s still pretty good. 🤷🏽‍♀️

I was today years old when I found out my life long insomnia is likely caused/massively heightened by Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.

I am also an anxious and ridiculous person.

But bloody hell.

EDS is the gift that keeps shitting.
Even 25 years after the initial diagnosis.

REALLY?

Update: went well.

Didn’t swear.

Didn’t piss myself. 👍🏽 

Trying!!! ❤️

I totally Understand!
 
This is an eating disorder based issue, and I’ve been invited to speak as a survivor of the disease.

Hello I’m one of many speakers on the matter and the only one with a public profile.

Speaking in congress today in 45 minutes.


If I have an early call time, I cannot sleep until 15 minutes before said call time.
Because my insomniac, hyper pressured mind is my enemy.
My eyes are going to look as though they had been replaced by actual bollocks.

Thinking you can walk into @Sephora for 1 thing... and that you will leave with 1 thing. 

The question is, will the algorithms even send this information to Trump supporters?

I love him.


I’m shooting my dream campaign tomorrow.
Little south Asian me never thought I’d see it. ❤️ 

Here I am playing Frolf. Frisby golf.
Do I apply for the Olympics now?
Or...?


Jesus.


My new obsession.

Omg.
This thread. 

I used to be a massive prick on here when I was younger, angrier and more mentally unstable.
Made me feel powerful and in control for about 3 seconds.
I get it.
Nothing says “help me” more than going out of your way to troll a stranger.


Playing frolf. Frisby golf. 
It is a hilarious game.
Highly recommend.
Happy weekend.


Imagine spending your Saturday looking for a photo from almost 3 years ago to try and drag someone for clicks. 😂 

Hey, any of you know any fabulous fat pole dancers?
Don’t have to be professionals, can just be great.
Can you tag them/yourself below?
(This is for a music video) I will block and report any unkind/fatphobic messages.)

This, as well as so many great interview with amazing voices/activists are now live on my personal YouTube channel.YouTube/jameelajamil.
Come join us as we learn from the best. ❤️ 


I completely hear the exhaustion and frustration over voting for those who felt ignored and unprotected under the democrats previously.
But PLEASE read this important thread about what happens if you don’t use your voice and opportunity to fight for your rights this November. ❤️

I love how much dogs love.

So silly.


“Britain is not a racist country.” 

Throw in a mini fridge and this is *exactly* how I would decorate a home if James wasn’t here.


Wow 

Hilarious.


This is a yes or no question surely.


I am speaking in congress on Tuesday regarding prevention of weight discrimination in schools.
I am nervous.

While It’s frustrating to just have people write wild shit about you, spread misinformation and hate...all the time, and twist everything you do/say and not be able to fight back, I get why it’s problematic for me to do it on this easily spreadable and increasingly toxic site.


Wait... what? 🤯

He destroys all of my stuff but I love him.


Most beautiful song about mental health that I have maybe ever heard.
From the perspective of the person who loves someone struggling.
Means the world to me.


Best thing I’ve seen in ages.


Omg!!!!!

I threaten the tabloid media because it exists on advertising, mostly from products to make women more “attractive.” They prey on the very insecurities I work to dismantle and so I’m making their jobs harder so they’re doubling down on me, and I don’t give a fuck.
I’m staying.

I’m so proud of what we are doing with I Weigh on my YouTube channel!!! The mini series’ we are handing over to other activists/social commentators are SO good.
Their voices and perspectives are brilliant.
This series is especially lols.


So, so horrifying.



Follow @Imani_Barbarin a leading voice of reason.


Oh my god @iSmashFizzle ❤️
