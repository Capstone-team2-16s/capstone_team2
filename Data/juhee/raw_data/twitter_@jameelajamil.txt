This is 👌🏽

It is hilarious to be nominated in a list of all my Favourite people.

Thanks @peopleschoice for making my inner child LOL at this.


The desperation for a hot take here  is cute.
This is one of the cutest of these so far.

My boyfriend‘s voice singing over all these family hugging vids is 🥰 even to my cold English heart.

👍🏽

Welp.

The most British and enjoyable Sunday read.

I am forever obsessed with him.

😂 

Lol fuck off

#NewProfilePic


Found someone to laugh with every day for 6 years. 👍🏽

#NationalBoyfriendDay

*pretends to be shocked.* 

EXACTLY

You don’t have to kick a guy about his health to just point out what makes him an inappropriate candidate.

I am encouraged by a reality tv star who lost his father’s money 5 times and hasn’t paid taxes for 15 years becoming the president.

There are no rules!


Turning the other cheek is not going to win this election.

It’s like fighting fire with lube...… 

Keep. Going. 
❤️ also well done 

😶

Hoping this excitement has made your night hun.

#dreambig ❤️

Maybe there you will have the courage to show your real name and picture?

Yeah I’m not exactly dying to meet you either.

Don’t, even for a second, take your eyes off his taxes, his Proud Boys signal, his refusal to denounce white supremacy, or the replacement of RBG which threatens reproductive rights.

Nobody is talking about his taxes or his white supremacy slip.
Well. Nobody is talking about his taxes anymore...

What Chrissy has done is fucking brave and admirable.

Miscarriage should not be a taboo subject.

She is helping normalize this delicate and important and very, very needed conversation.

It was massively generous to choose to be so open in this moment.

Celiac Twitter, when you accidentally eat gluten what do you do?
😇

I am.

Glitter is a fantastic work of art with an amazing soundtrack.

Sue me.

LOL.

That is Rihanna.

I could NEVER.

She is 😍

#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽

Ahahahahaha

I thought the same.
But I have to say...

I just tried it... and I don’t hate it. 
I actually liked it. 
So I cancel myself.
Goodbye.

Update: it’s surprisingly good

The most 2020 looking pizza turned up tonight.

But ya know what they say... pizza is like sex, when it’s good it’s really good, and when it’s bad... 
it’s still pretty good. 🤷🏽‍♀️

I was today years old when I found out my life long insomnia is likely caused/massively heightened by Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.

I am also an anxious and ridiculous person.

But bloody hell.

EDS is the gift that keeps shitting.
Even 25 years after the initial diagnosis.

REALLY?

Update: went well.

Didn’t swear.

Didn’t piss myself. 👍🏽 

Trying!!! ❤️

I totally Understand!
 
This is an eating disorder based issue, and I’ve been invited to speak as a survivor of the disease.

Hello I’m one of many speakers on the matter and the only one with a public profile.

Speaking in congress today in 45 minutes.


If I have an early call time, I cannot sleep until 15 minutes before said call time.
Because my insomniac, hyper pressured mind is my enemy.
My eyes are going to look as though they had been replaced by actual bollocks.

Thinking you can walk into @Sephora for 1 thing... and that you will leave with 1 thing. 

The question is, will the algorithms even send this information to Trump supporters?

👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 


I love him.


I’m shooting my dream campaign tomorrow.
Little south Asian me never thought I’d see it. ❤️ 

Here I am playing Frolf. Frisby golf.
Do I apply for the Olympics now?
Or...?


Jesus.


My new obsession.

Omg.
This thread. 

I used to be a massive prick on here when I was younger, angrier and more mentally unstable.
Made me feel powerful and in control for about 3 seconds.
I get it.
Nothing says “help me” more than going out of your way to troll a stranger.


Playing frolf. Frisby golf. 
It is a hilarious game.
Highly recommend.
Happy weekend.


Imagine spending your Saturday looking for a photo from almost 3 years ago to try and drag someone for clicks. 😂 

Hey, any of you know any fabulous fat pole dancers?
Don’t have to be professionals, can just be great.
Can you tag them/yourself below?
(This is for a music video) I will block and report any unkind/fatphobic messages.)

This, as well as so many great interview with amazing voices/activists are now live on my personal YouTube channel.YouTube/jameelajamil.
Come join us as we learn from the best. ❤️ 


I completely hear the exhaustion and frustration over voting for those who felt ignored and unprotected under the democrats previously.
But PLEASE read this important thread about what happens if you don’t use your voice and opportunity to fight for your rights this November. ❤️

I love how much dogs love.

So silly.


“Britain is not a racist country.” 

Throw in a mini fridge and this is *exactly* how I would decorate a home if James wasn’t here.


Wow 

Hilarious.


This is a yes or no question surely.


I am speaking in congress on Tuesday regarding prevention of weight discrimination in schools.
I am nervous.

While It’s frustrating to just have people write wild shit about you, spread misinformation and hate...all the time, and twist everything you do/say and not be able to fight back, I get why it’s problematic for me to do it on this easily spreadable and increasingly toxic site.


Wait... what? 🤯

He destroys all of my stuff but I love him.


Most beautiful song about mental health that I have maybe ever heard.
From the perspective of the person who loves someone struggling.
Means the world to me.


Best thing I’ve seen in ages.


Omg!!!!!

I threaten the tabloid media because it exists on advertising, mostly from products to make women more “attractive.” They prey on the very insecurities I work to dismantle and so I’m making their jobs harder so they’re doubling down on me, and I don’t give a fuck.
I’m staying.

I’m so proud of what we are doing with I Weigh on my YouTube channel!!! The mini series’ we are handing over to other activists/social commentators are SO good.
Their voices and perspectives are brilliant.
This series is especially lols.


So, so horrifying.



Follow @Imani_Barbarin a leading voice of reason.


Oh my god @iSmashFizzle ❤️
 
Thank you to everyone supporting the podcast, we are now at 600k listeners!

I’m so excited for him to take over Hollywood.

#paapaessiedu
This Feels Weird 
Important!
 
God I love him.


I hear BTS like @nbcthegoodplace so life is pretty good.

And Money and help!🧡
