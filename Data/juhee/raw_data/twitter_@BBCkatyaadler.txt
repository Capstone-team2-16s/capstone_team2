Key that EU mentions legal texts. UK has been very frustrated that EU up until now wouldn’t engage in starting to draft joint legal texts around (the considerable amount of) areas where there is agreement between the two sides 
#brexit
EU says it’s repeated its offer to hold intensified talks with U.K. negotiators .. 
Brussels waits to hear government reply👇
#brexit
EU has said many times it doesn’t care how PM ‘sells’ a deal he agrees with them. 
Brussels understands politics. Even if PM makes concessions (he will have to-as EU will too-to agree a deal) he’ll want to shout victory to help him sell the deal back home**See Withdrawal Agreement
If EU openly engages on fish, that’ll help UK engage in other tough issues  of greater importance to EU as a whole - like governance and level playing field -especially state aid. 
If the UK doesn’t budge at all - there’ll be no deal anyway
Important to EU coastal states was being SEEN by their fishing communities to be standing up for their rights in a deal with UK. 
Arguably they can now say they’ve done that but that now the chances of getting ANY deal and therefore ANY quotas at all in UK waters is at risk
But EU coastal states have been demanding that the UK move more on competition regulations BEFORE they openly talk fish concessions. 
Might they now move earlier with window closing on possibility of a deal and cost of no deal being far bigger than cost of smaller fish quotas?
It’s an open secret in EU circles -as Macron admitted on Friday -that it will have to compromise on fish. 
Fish will be a ‘win’ for the PM whatever the final deal looks like (if there is a deal in the end). 
Still to be negotiated is how big a UK win / EU compromise of cours
alluded to that at the summit? 
There’s little expectation in Brussels that real negotiations could now happen this week. 
At least first half. 
It’s been a frustration of EU chief negotiator Barnier that EU coastal nations wouldn’t let him start talking fish compromises already
It fundamentally changes its position. Is it enough to declare EU wants 
Intensive talks. 
If so, Barnier said that over + over in his press conference on Thursday) and EU admission that it needs to compromise too. Not only UK. 
If so, Angela Merkel and Dutch PM Mark Rutte
Yes, they did that to show they weren’t ‘bowing to UK pressure’ 
as one diplomat put it to me. 
Boris Johnson has declared the summit a deadline for talks. Not the EU. 
BUT that decision by EU leaders was clearly a misstep. 
The PM says the EU can now come to him if
EU must know PM needs to show a win here. 
It was short-sighted of EU leaders to put onus of compromising solely on the UK in their summit conclusions last week and to intentionally remove the word ‘intensive’ from their call to continue negotiations
eg dynamic alignment for state aid But UK must know Brussels will not compromise on protecting single market -not just in practical terms but also so other trade partners can see the EU has strict rules and more recalcitrant EU member states can see its serious too. 
Equally..
As @DavidHenigUK wrote this weekend. 
But the EU’s level playing field demands come as no surprise to UK. 
They were in the political declaration signed by both sides last year outlining intentions for their future relations. 
Brussels has rowed back on maximalist demands 
Big problem is that both sides are so suspicious of each other. 
EU doesn’t trust UK gov to keep its word (it points to Internal Market Bill as a case in point). 
UK accuses EU of not accepting its sovereignty and trying to keep post #Brexit UK tied to EU rules. 
Both have a point
EU+UK chief negotiators are speaking this afternoon. 
What will it take to re-start talks? 
I’d argue it’s not about specifics. 
It’s about political will. 
Do the PM and EU really want a deal? 
If answer is yes, then both sides know they must compromise + a deal is there to be done
Belgian Health Minister has announced on broadcaster RTL that as regards #Covid the government is no longer in control of what’s happening.

Macron says: The British have much more need of a post-Brexit deal than the EU. 
The EU is ready to continue negotiations. Our conditions are clear and well-known. 
It's now for the UK to choose if it wants a deal or not
Yes 👇 https://t.co/vWFXvkcNaq
For all those writing to me about Macron‘s tweet yesterday - here it is 👇 https://t.co/wAEnbv9yaQ
So: are EU-UK trade talks finished /done kaputt /over for good?👇 https://t.co/ebccdv5r8E
Interesting👇
I think EU assumed UK knew Brussels would move on fish in the end. 
It was tricky for Barnier‘s negotiating team. 
They wanted to move earlier on fish but were held back by EU coastal states esp France - who insisted on seeing UK compromise on competition rules first
New #covid restrictions in Belgium. 
Nationwide curfew from midnight to 5am. 
All cafes and restaurants shut for a month from Monday. 
One close personal contact allowed per month apart from people you live with.
Oui!
Indeed!!😆
Macron responds to PMs spokesman saying ‚trade talks are over’. 
Macron: „The British have much more need of a post-Brexit deal than the EU. 
The EU is ready to continue negotiations. Our conditions are clear and well-known. 
It's now for the UK to choose if it wants a deal or not“
Macron says the EU wants a deal which he says is why EU leaders authorised Michel Barnier to keep negotiating. 
But underlined Macron again: not a deal at any price #Brexit
"We're not going to negotiate through the media" was Angela Merkel's response when asked to react to Boris Johnson saying the EU needed to fundamentally change its attitude for negotiations to continue  #Brexit
Asked about Boris Johnson saying today that the UK should prepare for no deal with the EU - Angela Merkel said the EU is also prepared for no deal. 
Neither side wants a deal at any price she said but she said the EU and she personally thinks negotiations should continue #Brexit
She said leaders were trying to find ways to reduce person-to-person contacts in their countries (ie increased social restrictions) to reduce the number of individuals who have to be traced when someone tests positive for covid 
Merkel says all EU leaders at summit agreed test and trace is currently the best way to try and control spread of #covid
Angela Merkel in her post summit press conference says negotiations with the UK will continue and she says her opinion is that it's in the interest of both sides to agree a deal. 
#Brexit
Opinion of Boris Johnson’s statement this afternoon on the trade negotiations from well-connected EU diplomat: „
His message was as always mainly domestic.“ „
And he did not say that he did not want to talk any further.“ 
#Brexit
Germany’s ‘Die Zeit’ notes the PM demanded that the EU ‘fundamentally change’ its attitude in trade talks otherwise it’s time to prepare for no deal 
BUT the paper also emphasis Boris Johnson stopped short of walking away from negotiations altogether
EU negotiating team head to London on Monday 👇 https://t.co/jZtClOe1WV
EU negotiating going to London on Monday 👇 https://t.co/jZtClOe1WV
Both sides have now growled at one another. Done a bit of teeth baring. 
Is this the political posturing before difficult compromises are made? 
Again: concessions are needed by BOTH sides for a deal to be reached. 
Let’s see what next week brings..
The PM says EU has been dragging feet so if serious about a deal they can come to U.K. 
That’s exactly what EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday proposed to do: 
Travel to London on Monday to start ‘intense’ ‘sped up’ negotiations ‘even working on the weekend if needed’
PM says to prepare for no deal with EU. 
At their summit EU leaders pushed the Commission to ideas ahead with no deal preparations BUT both sides still talking and that’s the bottom line 
#Brexit
Horse-trading in last stages of negotiations..
Early on it was mused EU might use a deal on financial services for the U.K. (something Brussels decides unilaterally outside current trade talks) to get leverage on fisheries. 
Here the suggestion is a link between fish and energy👇
The Finnish PM has become the second EU leader to leave their summit in Brussels, after a recent contact of hers tested positive for Covid-19. 
Yesterday the European Commission President left the summit after a member of her team tested positive
Last thing EU wants is to add the political, practical and financial headache of no deal with the UK to their current public health and financial crisis provoked by #Covid 
They assume the PM feels the same way but EU believes he needs this trade deal more and so they squeeze.. 
EU diplomats admit they’re trying to put UK under pressure. Are we surprised? 
The PM will no doubt make a tough-sounding statement of his own today. 
In negotiations each side naturally wants to get the maximum possible while giving the minimum away. 
That’s where we are now
Interesting to note that after EU leaders signed off on yesterday’s formal Brexit conclusions, they had a closed-door meeting with no mobile devices allowed. 
Of course they discussed possible compromises EU could make to reach a deal. 
We heard as much from Angela Merkel BUT
Macron is focused on upcoming French presidential elections. His main rival: a nationalist eurosceptic. 
When he insists publicly about maintaining French fishing rights in UK waters because they didn’t choose #Brexit -his aim is to sound nationalist + show leaving EU is costly
EU leaders also play to their domestic gallery. This is the last stage of the trade negotiations. 
We’re poised ahead of the chapter of Big Compromises. 
Neither the U.K. nor the EU want to go first. 
Both want to signal to their home crowd that THEIR interests are being protected
Chief UK negotiator David Frost was quick to react last night - objecting o EU leaders’ tougher-sounding-than-could-have-been formal conclusions to their #Brexit discussion but since when are politicians declarations  taken without a pinch or two of salt?
Coronavirus, CORONAVIRUS, bit of Brexit and some chocolate👇 https://t.co/XLOubF2UNI
European Commission moves to reassure UK it wants to continue INTENSIVE talks - even if adjective was absent from EU leaders written conclusions following their Brexit discussion today. 
Details matter. 
UK chief negotiator David Frost just took to Twitter noting absence of word
EU standing firm in public : says ball now in U.K. court to take moves to make trade deal possible and insisting internal market bill must be changed 👇
Tomorrow it’s over to the PM who said he’ll announce the UK’s next steps
UK’s chief negotiator responds to EU summit conclusions calling on UK « to make the necessary moves to make agreement possible » while calling for ongoing EU-UK talks but not INTENSIVE negotiations 👇
EU leaders conclusions after discussing post #Brexit trade negotiations. 
Note point 5 which puts burden of responsibility on the U.K. to make compromises in order to reach a deal👇EU leaders are more preoccupied with rising #COVID infections than trade negotiations right now..
Sánchez concluded « So we fully support Michel Barnier and hope that in these coming weeks we can achieve this deal that gives certainty and trust in this difficult moment the world is going through with the second wave of Covid. »
« The first is LPF, second is fishing, and the third involves some elements of the commercial links between the UK and EU. 
Obviously for Spain this deal is fundamental – given our historic relationship with the UK as well as our shared commercial and economic interests. »
Spain’s PM Sanchez on #Brexit as he arrived at EU leaders summit: 
« The most important thing is to emphasise our desire for a deal; secondly to maintain unity of the EU27 on our objectives and the thorny issues that still need to be sorted out »
Agreed! 
Macron sounding forthright but considering his is considered the maximalist position in EU when it comes to fishing, he makes no reference here to Brussels’ original demand of pretty much keeping same fishing quotas as when UK was a member state
Merkel on #Brexit as she heads into the EU leaders’ 2 day summit: 
« We want a deal but of course not at any price. 
It has to be a fair deal that both sides can profit from. 
But all efforts are worth it and we will support the negotiations of Michel Barnier + Ursula vonder Leyen »
Macron insisted »I want to be clear: 
this deal will not be made at any price. If these conditions are not met, it’s possible there won’t be a deal. 
We are ready for that. 
France is ready for that. 
We are in the process of finalising. ..
We are ready for a no-deal. »
Macron added «The second issue we need to have fair conditions between the UK and EU to assure us that we have a level playing field on state aid and regulations, especially socially and environmentally. 
Brexit should not create social or environmental ‘dumping’ on our border »
Macron in full #Brexit bad cop mode as he arrived at the EU leaders summit. 
He said : « on no account will our fishermen be sacrificed for Brexit. We didn’t choose Brexit, the British people did. 
So preserving our fishermen’s access to the UK’s waters allows a good compromise»
Worth saying too that summit conclusions will be drafted and redrafted over the two day meeting
France’s Europe Minister talks of one single objective👇: to defend and protect the rights of French fisher people .. 
This, just ahead of todays EU leaders summit where #Brexit trade talks and possible EU compromises are to be explored ..
EU leaders are set to discuss post Brexit trade talks for the first time in months. 
Brussels’ demands from the U.K. are well known. 
What leaders need to debate at their summit now is how far THEY might compromise to get a deal. 
The actual Macron quote on the test and trace app 👇 https://t.co/4FdKruU0Wc
CORRECTION seems he said UK and Germany has better test and trace apps than France. 
He says France was changing its one
President Macron said this evening the UK and German test and trace apps worked better than the French one to date NOT as I first said that the test and trace SYTEMS worked better than the one in France but he added that no country had it right and that France was changing #covid
I did wonder.. 
The perils of live-tweeting. 
Must've half-heard
That must have been it. 
I was live tweeting and so could have half-heard at that point
If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on.”
His exact words on 7 Sept: “There needs to be an agreement with our European friends by the time of the European Council on 15 October if it’s going to be in force by the end of the year. 
So there is no sense in thinking about timelines that go beyond that point
That was the date when the PM said there was no point in talking all autumn and that a deal should be visible by mid October 
“expressed his disappointment that more progress had not been made over the past two weeks. 
The Prime Minister said that he looked forward to hearing the outcome of the European Council (this weeks EU leaders summit)
PM leaves threat of walking away from talks with the EU in the air. 
Following his call this evening with European Commission and European Council Presidents, his spokesman said the PM had noted the desirability of a deal, but
Commentators on French tv France24 saying Macron learned from his mistake from previous lockdown where informed mayors 39mins before public announcement and faced resistance from them. 
Now including them in decision process say commentators #Covid
But admits more needs to be done. Especially to keep people in work he says rather than relying on government economic help
Macron admits that #Covid has hit the most economically vulnerable in France the hardest bc he says they live in small flats, often together with older relatives and often they’re frontline workers. 
He says France has spent more than any other country to help the #Covid affected
Macron says Germany and UK have had better test and test systems than France so far but says no country has got it absolutely right yet #covid
Tester alerter protéger says Macron - France’s strategy for beat the virus : test, warn (those affected so they can quarantine), protect the rest of society. 
Basically test and trace. 
Till now he says the waiting #covid times have been too long
Appeals to them to meet but in fewer numbers. Appeals to the French to be less demonstrative in hugging and kissing wider family members and friends
He’s disseminating info by being questioned by 2 journos. One make, one female. He’s admitting how hard it is for people to lose civil liberties again. 
He’s recognising that the young are paying a huge price on cancelled exams and apprenticeships , curbs on their social life
This is a very different Macron than the ‘high and mighty’ president who declared war in #Covid in a dramatic address to the nation at the start of the pandemic. Tonight instead of decreeing new restrictions from up high, Macron has chosen a very different, humbler style + tone
Macron has announced additional financial support for areas with additional #covid restrictions. 
He also announced fines of between 135 and 1,500 euros for those caught breaking the nighttime curfew to be introduced in Paris and 8 other towns and cities from Saturday
Regarding new #covid restrictions to be introduced in France from Saturday Macron says he trusts in people’s sense of civic responsibility.. but adds that there will be controls
Macron says “we have to keep working, children have to keep going to school but #covid19 levels are “concerning” he says - 
hence introduction of nighttime curfews at least for 4 weeks in Paris île de France and 8 other metropolitan areas including Lyon
Macron declares new state of (health) emergency from Saturday #COVID19
Macron announces night time curfews in 8 metropolitan area from 9pm to 6am for 4 to 6 weeks starting this coming Saturday #COVID19
Possibly more significant than the call this eve between the PM and the European Commission Président about post #Brexit negotiations.. will be the intra EU discussion beginning at this week’s summit about how much to compromise to get a deal with UK 👇
Congrats @TVNaga01 !!!!
PM’s call with European Commission President will take place at 1930 BST. 
The President of the European Council will also be on the call .. ahead of hosting EU leaders for a two day summit starting tomorrow. 
Post #Brexit trade talks are scheduled to be first topic at EU summit
Government takes steps to secure medical supplies for U.K. regardless of outcome of post #Brexit trade talks with the EU 👇
NEW! PM will speak to European Commission Pres Ursula von der Leyen tomorrow afternoon to discuss progress and the lack of it in key areas of trade negotiations. 
This ahead of a summit of EU leaders on Thurs and Friday where the talks will be discussed amongst other issues
The general EU mood is: countries really still want and hope for a deal with the UK but if price is deemed too high or UK walks away then „so be it“. 
t’ll be costly + difficult, the EU Argument now goes, but they say their primary focus is now on a „bigger“ problem: #COVID19 
In the form of publicly berating the EU or threatening Brussels with a UK walkout from negotiations. 
On the latter, diplomats tell me that after previous threats of dying in ditches and a number of missed brexit deadlines, the EU does not take the PM‘s Ultimatums too seriously
EU diplomats also wonder aloud if the PM has ‚something up his sleeve‘ ahead of the summit- either constructive, muse the diplomats, eg a compromise position on the level playing field (in the knowledge that the EU will then compromise on fish) or a „destructive“ move.. 
Nervous diplomats tell me they’re not sure what mood Macron will arrive in to the summit. 
Will he play ball with EU majority or insist on playing ‚Brexit bad cop‘ role, sticking to the maximalist position on fishing for example?
Until the UK government removes clauses from its internal market bill that contradict the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.. 
This is the current EU thinking regarding Brexit and the summit BUT
There are no negotiating rounds planned passed this week but there will be. 
EU diplomats guess the summit will see EU Leaders announcing they want a deal but not at any price; that they will continue negotiating „calmly“ and that they won’t ratify a deal, even if one is agreed
Both sides say they still want a deal and think it entirely possible to reach a deal this year, infact v soon, if only the OTHER side would just be „more realistic“ (ie make the big compromises) 
They have assumed that the UK would be more willing to compromise the longer the process ran, but in fact all these tactics have achieved is to get us to the middle of October with lots of work that could have been done left undone.“
This clearly will not be the case and each side predictably blames the other for that. 
Today a UK government source said: „The EU have been using the old playbook in which they thought running down the clock would work against the UK“
This briefing comes ahead of the EU leaders summit in Brussels end of this week, where Brexit will be discussed most likely I’m told on Friday morning. 
Both Michel Barnier and the PM once described this summit mid October as cut off point by which time a deal had to be agreed
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has briefed Europe Ministers from EU member states that progress continues to be made in negotiations with the UK but not significantly when it comes to key sticking points: level playing field, fish, governance of deal
Before that though the Dutch government is today expected to announce the short term closure of all cafes, restaurants and bars - also a ban on the sale of alcohol in the evening
After Belgium’s health minister warned of possible impending #coronavirus lockdown, RTL Nieuws reports the Netherlands could re-enter what the government called an “intelligent lockdown” if national rate of infection didn’t improve
Europe Ministers from EU countries have just been briefed on state of play in post #Brexit trade negotiations with UK 👇
Hope in Brussels is that a deal is still possible this year BUT big bumps still in the road between now and then
Remember services? 
The dominant sector in UK economy..?? 
Even if there’s a trade deal with EU this year, services have not been prioritised in these negotiations👇
This system does NOT include harmonising coronavirus test and trace systems or the when, why’s or how’s of lockdown rules in EU countries. 
Public health is a national competency (not decided in Brussels). 
EU members still stumbling through dealing with virus nation by nation
Under the scheme, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) will publish a map (to be updated weekly) that categories EU regions (not whole countries) into green, orange and red zones (or grey, for insufficient data)
It’s an attempt by Brussels to avoid unilateral border closures between EU members and the collapse of the Schengen passport free travel area That we saw during the first corona virus wave
EU countries are today expected to formally give the green light (sorry!) to a common #COVID19 traffic light system designed to ease travel across the bloc despite rising numbers of infections


Lessons from 2016 when ‘populist’ parties took centre stage largely bc voters felt complacent traditional politicians weren’t listening to their concerns. Many traditional parties have since adopted ‘populist’ elements. 
Always hard to generalise but there are patterns we can see

That scandal of course is peculiar to the FPÖ but you’ll notice across Europe that more extreme parties have generally not made political hay despite national governments everywhere struggling with Covid. 
Also it’s true across much of Europe that mainstream parties have ‘learned’

borrowed themes from the far right/nationalist right, like being tough on immigration (see Austria’s PP in government). 
More extreme parties are also losing support in number of European countries because faced with a pandemic, many voters say feel safer w traditional parties

After receiving a massive slap in the face in Vienna’s municipal elections yesterday, Austria’s far right Freedom Party plans to take a good look at itself👇
As in the NL, many voters in Austria who’d flirted with the far right are now turning to centre right parties that have

Domestic necessities are sucking up leaders time/attention eg Boris Johnson’s big statement today; 
Macron’s expected on Weds.This when political leaders do need to lend attention to Brexit to approve uncomfortable compromises neededboth sides of Channel if deal is to be reached

As predicted early in negotiations, the risk UK and EU took in leaving the big issues till the last moment this autumn (and of course each side blames the other for doing that) is that #COVID19 is back with a vengeance


If that is agreed, EU thinking is that its coastal states will compromise considerably on fish. 
This won’t all happen this week clearly. 
EU expectation is IF deal emerges, it’ll be (mid, even late) November

n state aid, environment, labour regulations etc. Brussels also insisting on robust dispute mechanism (esp after Internal Mkt Bill surprise) to take swift, weighty legal action if treaty terms breached by either side

for the U.K. getting zero tariff zero quota access to the single market. 
NB While most in EU recognise the U.K. post Brexit can’t/won’t sign up to Brussels rules in perpetuity the EU will insist on at least signing up to mutually agreed norms/principles

EU expectation is that France will play hardball as it did in Brexit divorce negotiations last year. But France is not only fishing state afraid of losing quotas in UK waters. 
France also not alone in worrying about what EU sees as ‘fair competition’ rules in exchange

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will brief Europe Ministers of the 27 member states (or as many of them as attend tomorrow’s General Affairs Council). 
This ahead of the EU leaders summit in Brussels this Thurs and Friday where #Brexit will be discussed amongst others topics 

Clearly no Brexit trade deal ready by 15 Oct as the PM has wanted BUT talks continue apace. 
This week in Brussels (Monday to Wednesday) focussing on fish and level playing field (including governance) in particular

Berlin #coronavirus restrictions 👇 https://t.co/9pgfsdsalA

Angela Merkel has warned that Germans will face tighter corona restrictions in 10 days if a rise in infections isn’t stopped. 
Mrs Merkel held an online conference with the leaders of 11 German cities to discuss a sharp increase in case numbers #coronavirus

Germany’s Health Minister describes rising infection rates as “alarming”/“worrying”👇
German health officials have warned #coronavirus second wave could be more severe than the one in the spring.

The Spanish government has declared a “state of alarm” (as it’s known in the Spanish constitution) in Madrid. 
This, to force through #coronavirus measures that Madrid’s regional government had rejected..👇

Including the central and Eastern Europeans. Macron described to me as divisive figure in EU and as being “up a tree over Brexit”. 
We can’t forget Macron is also in election mode ahead of next French presidential vote and wants to be seen as protecting French interests

Of course everyone EU-side recognises challenges of Covid and economic consequences but.. I’ve heard predictions of a Johnson-Merkel meeting or at least ‘high profile phone chat’. 
Germany has rotating presidency of EU. Merkel also seen as able to bring EU centre around her

But EU coastal nations will only move (and yes, reluctantly so) when they see the UK has moved too over other issues. 
It’s seen as important in EU that Boris Johnson now in contact with EU Commission Pres von der Leyen. 
“He’s left it lamentably late to get involved” is EU view

Won’t move from their fishing rights claims till see UK concessions over governance and LPF. 
But I disagree with recent reports saying EU coastal nations have toughened their stance against concessions over fish, full stop. 
EU won’t let this deal die over fish

Compromising over governance and level playing field UNLESS it can clearly see the EU will make key concessions over fish. 
And here we’re stuck in #Brexit chicken and egg AGAIN. 
While UK won’t move fully on LPF and governance till fish compromise is clear, EU coastal countries

his could be to distract public from concessions UK is preparing to make over governance and level playing field in the knowledge that the EU will make concessions for the UK over fish but EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has also recognised the UK will have difficulty

Of big three remaining issues EU wants to leave fish till last. 
First governance, then level playing field, then fish BUT there’s dawning recognition that won’t work for UK. 
David Frost has been sounding a loud warning over fish 

But it’s far, far from straightforward. Is there enough time for agreement? 
One high level diplomat suggested to me maybe both sides need a few months of no deal to clear their heads and get them to finish the deal in 2021. 
No-one in the EU thinks a deal possible in October


UK rejects ECJ involvement. 
EU accepts that. EU says can’t go through UK courts bc they follow domestic legislation. 
Both sides could found a stand alone court for this deal but that means agreeing norms bilaterally..
Maybe have a bilateral arbitration panel? 
It’s not insoluble

Problem is: what should that governance look like? This conundrum means we could be so very very very near to a deal (because fish can definitely be resolved. 
See below) and yet still fail to get one by end of transition. 
Governance conundrum: 

While this means the issue of level playing field is en route to possibly being worked out via robust governance mechanism ie UK sovereignty *protected* by not having to sign up to agreed rules on state aid etc while EU single market is protected via a tough dispute mechanism..

It’s seen as v positive in EU that UK chief negotiator David Frost yesterday spoke of this dispute mechanism also working in UKs favour. 
EU sees that as sign of UK ´coming round’ BUT

In a deal with UK and that if UK businesses suddenly get an unfair competitive advantage bc spending less on environmental regulations or receiving more in state aid, then EU wants to be able to take speedy action via dispute mechanism.

U keener on this than ever in a deal with UK following the government threat to override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement with its internal market bill. 
EU leaders say they need to justify an eventual deal to their voters. 
Proof haven’t sold out French/Dutch/German interests

While UK side keeps *banging on* about fish fish fish .. the Brussels end of post #Brexit trade negotiations now *harps on* (AND ON) about governance ie need for a robust dispute mechanism with teeth allowing for swift legal action (including suspending chunks of whole deal)

Blimey 


Of course we’re not there yet and don’t be surprised if the EU-UK mood music becomes more ominous again as this month progresses but the general sense (hope) in EU circles is that a deal can/will be struck in November

Usual caveats: 
nothing is certain etc and what UK/EU say in public may not match 100% what’s happening in closed talks but hearing David Frost talk about common principles on state aid and need for UK too of a robust dispute mechanism in EU-UK deal will be music to EU ears

From Downing Street statements following PMs call today with EU Chief negotiator Michel Barnier plus statements by Michael Gove and the UKs chief negotiator David Frost to the House of Lords EU Committee it is clear the government is in deal mode and sees progress in EU talks

“The Prime Minister reiterated that any deal must reflect what the British people voted for and that businesses and citizens needed certainty very soon on the terms of our future relationship. They agreed to remain in touch on this issue.” 

« Although some progress had been made in recent discussions, they acknowledged that significant areas of difference remain, particularly on fisheries. 
Chief Negotiators should continue to work intensively in the coming days to try to bridge the gaps. »

But « He also underlined the UK was prepared to end the transition period on Australia-style terms if an agreement could not be found. 
» ie no trade deal 

Re cal’ today between PM and EU Chief negotiator Michel Barnier, a 
Downing Street spokesperson said:
« The Prime Minister outlined our clear commitment to trying to reach an agreement, underlining that a deal was better for both sides. »

Adding that people both sides of Channel had already been through much bc of #coronavirus 
It therefore would be “totally irresponsible to burden them with additional problems resulting from a no-deal" he said

Germany’s Foreign Minister has met the EU’s chief negotiator in trade talks w UK Michel Barnier this morning.

As we heard from leaders like NL’s Rutte and Germany’s Merkel, they are ‘cautiously optimistic’ BUT while a deal is thought likely, it’s far from definite.

EU view is still that decision must ultimately be made in Downing Street.

Though the PM insists it depends more on the EU

Fish is not THE key issue but it is a key bargaining chip and do will be agreed close to last.

Neither EU nor UK will want to be seen to be the first to give up on these negotiations.

EU diplomats think they could continue into November

Well-connected EU diplomat told me he thinks Michel Barnier will have to push EU leaders to show more flexibility.

Angela Merkel seemed to nod to that on Friday.

The U.K. will need to move considerably on its current official positions on level playing field and governance

The fact the two leaders didn’t issue a joint statement trumpeting the details of compromise solutions already being worked on doesn’t mean they can’t or won’t happen.

Fact that PM and VdL will be in regular contact now is significant.

Lots more to-ing and fro-ing predicted

It would seem neither the wildly positive sounding rumours out of the U.K. last week on agreed solutions being found to state aid, nor the doom and gloomsters saying nothing is going nowhere fast(!) on tough issues in talks following the PM-VdL phone call this week are correct

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier heads to Berlin tomorrow morning for a meeting with Angela Merkel.

No trip scheduled to France the following day.

Possibly to London later in the week, I’m told

@pmdfoster used ‘meh’ in a tweet recently and it reminded me how much I like the word!
 
I’ve found myself using it all over the place last few days

If deal does appear, EU diplomats suggests won’t be before beginning/mid November

Themselves, then why on earth publicise that for politicians (mainly uk - rest of EU bored by #Brexit ) and media (mainly uk bc European press will only become interested if deal/no deal has domestic impact) to pull apart?

Lots of work to be done behind scenes

What a meh joint statement from Boris Johnson and EU Commission Pres this afternoon.

No tunnel.

Just intensified negotiations - What was the point?
you could ask OR It could be a positive sign they said so little.

If compromises are there to be made and both sides are readying

fisheries, the level playing field, and governance.. but not only those subjects, they noted.

They’ve agreed to keep in touch regularly from now on

Eu Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Boris Johnson have issued a joint statement following their call this afternoon.

Negotiations to agree a trade deal are now to be intensified.

Significant gaps remain (on well-known areas):

Good thread on what to expect next in #Brexit trade talks w EU.
This is political crunch time.

Deal can only be reached with EU + UK compromise and as I keep writing : 
don’t forget EU leaders -not just the PM - are affected by domestic politics 👇

ALL EU members are united in negotiations in prioritising welfare of single market over a deal with UK because EU countries earn a varying but considerable chunk of GDP out of that market.

That said, some in EU like Sweden, NL more open to some compromise than France for example

EU also not a clear cut case now we’re at the hard compromise-making stage.

Some member states open to being more flexible, others, eg France, don’t so much.

What I mean by flexible is not the fabled German carmakers.

“Since U.K. leaving the EU single market and customs union anyway, what’s the point of a deal that requires us to tie our hands to agreed rules with the EU?

Better to cut lose completely and have full sovereignty”

Complicating matters when it comes to the EU and U.K. ‘positions’ in the final stretch of negotiations ..

There are different voices around the PM - some more keen to do a deal with EU, others who say:

How significant is tomorrow's video conference between Boris John and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen: 
Is a trade deal about to be struck - or just more same old finger-pointing?

My thoughts: https://www.bbc.com/news/correspondents/katyaadlerdent

But as @DavidHenigUK points out - very VERY unlikely either EU or UK will allow talks to collapse over fish - however totemic the issue is

Brussels has to show more realism said David Frost - a recognition that post Brexit UK is an independent country.

He concluded that the UK remained committed to finding solutions - if they were to be found - he said

Angela Merkel and EU leaders sounded (very very) cautiously optimistic about possibility of a trade deal but UK’s chief negotiator David Frost struck sombre note.

Eg On fishing he warned  the gap with the EU risked being impossible to bridge

For many the virtual meeting tomorrow between the prime minister and the European Commission President is an encouraging sign.

Others - more wary - point out that just ahead of their call - each is still looking to the other to make concessions - in public at least #Brexit

The EU can sign a trade deal with UK despite triggering legal action over government’s internal market bill BUT the European Parliament says it will not ratify the deal if the government doesn’t remove the contentious clauses from the Bill that would override Withdrawal Agreement

Rutte also said a no-deal outcome would be “a big lost opportunity” on top of the economic fallout from the corona virus pandemic

Dutch PM Mark Rutte says he’s “cautiously optimistic” that EU-UK trade deal will be agreed this autumn.
Says “geopolitical necessity” for a deal was felt in Brussels and London bc covid and general instability

On subject of post #Brexit trade deal today Mrs Merkel said: 
A lot will be determined by what Britain wants and what Britain does not want.

It is up to Britain to decide this really.

But as long as the negotiations keep going I am optimistic.


Reports that EU chief negotiator will fly to Berlin on Monday for talks with Germany’s Angela Merkel

And on the parallel talks with UK on how to implement last year's Brexit Divorce Deal 
- she said everything was there to sort out the difficulties over the Irish Protocol and she called for it to be implemented in good faith

She said if UK wants "full access to single market" it would need to "respect questions of fairness and competitiveness".
 
She mentioned the importance to EU of having a dispute mechanism written in to the deal.

She said it was worth working hard to achieve a deal

As to whether she felt optimistic that a deal would be done, President VdL said "Where there is a will there is a way.

We have made progress in many fields" but added that most difficult aspects: fishing and level playing field esp state aid - are still "wide open" she said

but rejected word 'tunnel' to describe how negotiations should proceed.

President von der Leyen repeated well-known EU position  "We want a deal.
Better to have a deal as neighbours.
Also in times of covid - with its devastating economic consequences but not at any price."

European Commission President says her video conference with PM tomorrow is to take stock of negotiations and look ahead to the what next.

She will then inform EU leaders of the outcome of the conversation with Boris Johnson.

She mentioned need to intensify negotiations.

Indeed.
Though EU imagines if deal struck that will be far easier for Boris Johnson to do as the concerns reflected in the internal market bill will largely be dealt with in a zero tariff, zero quota agreement

NB I wrote ‘meeting’ in /7 .

Should read ‘conversation’.

No suggestion they are meeting in person at this stage

The why’s and what’s of tomorrow’s meeting is speculation for now.

The only thing we know for sure is: both sides say they want a deal.

But both say not at any price.

If a deal does eventually emerge, compromises will have to have been made by both sides

Macron is under pressure to compromise his maximalist position on fishing rights for EU fishermen in U.K. waters but it’s politically v sensitive for him.

He already has 2022 presidential elections on his mind.

Key rivals could accuse him of sacrificing French interests.

Media likely to scrutinise/attack compromises -making it harder for politicians to agree them.

This goes for the PM -who could (depending what’s agreed) be accused of compromising on #Brexit by some media and MPs in own party - but also for EU leaders like Emmanuel Macron.

There is real progress going on in negotiations but need (either optics or content) the political involvement of PM & Commission President.
Also if progress is in process of being made (ie politically difficult compromises),the two sides won’t want to come under press scrutiny

Unusual that there is no Barnier press conference today.

There normally is after negotiating rounds.

Could be bc there is an EU leaders summit going on separately in Brussels (discussing Turkey, Belarus and more) and EU wants to avoid press conference clashes OR 

Today the two chief negotiators David Frost (UK) and Michel Barnier (EU) meet after this week’s negotiating round.

There have been rumours of progress on key sticking points coming out of UK.
Not confirmed EU side so far


BREAKING: PM spokesperson says Boris Johnson will speak to European Commission President tomorrow to discuss state of EU-UK trade and security talks.

QUESTION: Will they announce enough progress being made that negotiating teams can now enter a media black-out tunnel?

Millions of congrats @BBCVickiYoung who has been announced as @BBCNews new Deputy Political Editor.

Am told Michel Barnier will not be briefing EU leaders about #Brexit at their Brussels summit tomorrow.

European Commission Pres will hold the Briefing while M Barnier meets UK chief negotiator David Frost.

No Barnier presser planned - v unusual after negotiating weeks.

Hmmmm..

Indeed.
But what EU did not do is take stronger action : halt trade negotiations.

As important to look at what EU did not do as what it did in this case, I think.

EU wants trade deal and hopes that would go long way to allaying any UK stated concerns about NIreland

Who is Belgium's new Prime Minister - in charge of a 7 party coalition put together nearly 18 months after general election ..?

EU set 30Sept deadline for UK government to withdraw parts of internal market bill that would override aspects of Irish Protocol contained in #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.

EU wants to show it keeps its word yet wants to avoid huge row.

Still hopes trade deal.

Hence slow process👇

“We need to create a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK’s internal market, ensure Ministers can always deliver on their obligations to Northern Ireland and protect the gains from the peace process.” says the spks.

In response to EU sending a letter of notice to government as party of infringement proceeds, government spokesman says: 
“We will respond to the letter in due course.

We have clearly set out our reasons for introducing the measures related to the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Yet the threat by No10 to break international law has been damaging amongst own MPs + internationally.

EU says will insist all the more now on having an independent body to police any eventual trade deal w U.K. - so as to be able to take swift legal action in case of disputes

So was it a ‘successful’ negotiating ploy by Downing Street all along?

You could say gov called the EU’s bluff.

Brussels threatened legal action over Bill but is actually clearly playing it slowly.

Doesn’t want to damage chances of agreeing a trade + future relations deal w UK

Allow progress in the committees with the U.K. to implement the Irish Protocol and Withdrawal Agreement at large to solve difficulties between the two sides.

If clear progress made on a) and b) in a month, EU hopes the problematic parts of Internal Market Bill become irrelevant

By giving the government one month, the EU hopes this will give time for both sides to progress towards a) an EU-UK trade deal, which could allay fears of U.K. gov about aspects of the Irish Protocol in Withdrawal Agreement and b)

Commission will give government one month to respond it says.

Meantime the Commission ‘stands by its commitments’ (this is a jab at Boris Johnson) and ‘will continue working hard to ensure timely implementation of withdrawal agreement’ says president von der Leyen

European Commission Président says sent letter of formal notice to UK government - the first step in infringement proceedings.

This, because has not removed party’s of internal market bill that could override aspects of #Brexit Withdrawal agreement 

Financial services aren’t part of EU-UK trade talks but issues are linked.

Securing equivalence for UK services -allowing post #Brexit access to single market -will arguably be easier if a trade deal is agreed BUT EU can withdraw equivalence unilaterally👇

I thought it odd too.

It does also appear in English-language version of the Spiegel but why not write letter in UK publication 
- if aimed at UK?

Germany’s Europe Minister has appealed for “cool heads” “pragmatism” and a “sensible solution” in a letter to the UK as post #Brexit trade negotiations enter the final phase.

He calls too for an end to “obsession” with who’s winning or losing in talks 👇


Yes.
And off record, EU national diplomats often say this isn’t a big issue for EU but state aid (the other issue affected by Internal Market Bill) is huge for them.
Could be tactics -Keep something up sleeve that’s easy to compromise over to bargain for another thing you want??

Michael Gove says U.K. and EU are willing to use “every second every minute every hour” to reach agreement on implementing the Withdrawal Agreement BUT EU says it’s seen no sign from government they will remove parts of internal market bill that override that co-signed agreement

PM’s spokesperson says while this week is the final formal round of EU-UK trade negotiations, he expects discussions to continue up to the EU leaders’s summit on 15 October.
He described atmosphere in talks as relatively positive – but that ‘much was to be done’..EU in agreement

EU Commission Vice Pres says “We are determined to do our utmost to get a deal on a Future partnership (with the U.K.) and on implementing the Withdrawal Agreement but a lot depends on what UK brings to the table”

“A lot if these decisions are politically sensitive but technical in nature (eg IT systems, VAT regime) so we will need to speed up frequency of meetings” says EU Commission Pres Sefcovic regarding meetings of the EU-UK committees for implementing Withdrawal Agreement 

“It’ll never be the EU who walks out on the negotiations” says EU Commission Vice Pres Sefcovic of the EU/UK trade talks #Brexit
EU says Brussels and UK still far apart on issue of whether businesses need to fill out exit declarations for goods leaving Northern Ireland
Maros Sefcovic EU Commission Vice President says got no indication today from Michael Gove that gov is planning to remove “contentious” parts of internal market bill.
That’s why he said the EU was looking at “all means available” to take legal action #Brexit 

EU Commission Vice Pres Sefcovic met Michael Gove in Brussels today in 3rd meeting of Joint Committee designed to oversee implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement aka Divorce Deal -huge EU concern has been the Internal Market Bill 

Huge #Brexit week starts today:It’s the last scheduled round of EU-UK negotiations to work out trade + other future relations eg police cooperation, security.
Today there’s an EU-UK meeting to discuss Internal Market Bill and if Downing Street intends to break the Divorce Deal 

Know you e heard it before but it really is crunch time this week in post #Brexit negotiations w the EU.
MEPs warning that the flow of medicine is endangered if no deal.. in the middle of a pandemic👇

Switzerland has voted to keep EU’s freedom of movement rules.
Switzerland is not an EU member and polls suggest majority prefer to retain sovereignty over laws and borders BUT most voters opted today to keep ties with EU (economic benefits)👇 

Keep an eye on Switzerland today..
Holding a referendum to end free movement - a key part of its relationship with the EU.
Many see lessons for UK’s post #Brexit relationship with Brussels here.
If the Swiss vote Yes today.. 

Yes👇EU leaders unlikely to engage till hear from Barnier there’s movement from UK.
Even then there’ll likely be quite some to and fro.
If/when deal almost there, it’s thought PM might meet EU Commission Pres before sign off of deal at General Affairs Council (not leaders summit) 

Bluster and posturing aside, how close are we to an EU-UK post #Brexit trade deal?
My thoughts from Brussels ahead of next week‘s formal negotiating round👇 

Honoured! Thank you.


Reaction in Brussels to this article 👇 is that either A) Downing Street is sending a message via journalist that it is now willing to make compromises - thereby immediately making a deal more likely (as Eu already said it‘s willing to compromise) OR ..

EU response to this👇is that « preparedness » will certainly be brought up at the Joint Committee meeting with Michael Gove on Monday.
Brussels says he has given EU his word that the Protocol will be implemented so EU taking his word for it ..

This week’s EU leaders summit now delayed as the host - European Council Pres Charles Michel - has gone into quarantine.
This, after a security officer with whom he was  “in close contact early last week” tested positive for Covid 19 

« The EU will not be renegotiating » 👇says bloc’s chief representative on the Joint Committee (JC) -the body created to oversee implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement - ahead of meeting his UK equivalent, Michael Gove next week
