Is something funny? 

The abortion debate often has a sweeping narrative, but it really is about countless heart-wrenching and sometimes life-and-death decisions. 
Gary Peters, a Michigan senator in a tough re-election fight, decided to go public with his story.

Waiting in line for hours to vote should be considered less a story on voter enthusiasm and more a story on voter suppression. 
No one should have to wait hours to vote.

Small in stature. 
Big in heart. 
One of the greats. 
There‚Äôs a hole now at second base. 

Let‚Äôs just say this is Dr. Fauci seeming far less than happy.

Seeing Donald Trump attack New York, California, and Illinois this morning reminds me of a guy who can‚Äôt get a date to the prom even thous his dad will let him borrow the BMW.
Not sure how the stock market going up as investors bake in Trump‚Äôs poll numbers plummeting is a case that the president should be using for his re-election.

Thank you
This is one stat where the White House is winning big time @kenjeong - and they‚Äôre probably tired of all the winning.


Congratulations to LeBron James and the Lakers. 
A title different in many ways from anything we‚Äôve seen. 
Also a shout out to the Heat for a hard fought series. 
No matter the circumstances, we saw the hearts of champions.

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
We‚Äôre taking the quarantine very seriously in our household and sometimes focus on what we‚Äôre missing. 
But to spend a gorgeous twilight on a balcony with a glass of wine and conversation with loved ones is to humbly count my blessings.

No bot here. üòÄ 
Also it would be helpful if people use the #HumanNatureFilm hashtag. üòÄ 

To the leaders of the present and future: 
Your voices are urgent and powerful. 
The world needs to listen. 
I know you are speaking! 
#DayOfTheGirl

Doesn‚Äôt everybody wear t-shirts under their button-downs just in case? 
My favorite is the tuxedo t-shirt, so you‚Äôre always ready for black tie.

Can we at least recognize that ‚ÄúCourt Packing‚Äù at all levels of the judiciary has been the Republican playbook for decades? 
Asking for Merrick Garland.

Maybe someone should tell the Taliban that it‚Äôs unclear how much impact endorsements have in a presidential race.

A few years back, I had the honor of interviewing Jennifer Doudna, who was just awarded A Nobel Prize! 
It was an eye-opening, wide-ranging conversation that led to our documentary HUMAN NATURE, now on @netflix. 
Our original discussion can be found here:

Flipping back and forth between two Texas teams. Despite any rivalries I pull hard for both.

Thank you for the kinds words and I am glad you found #WhatUnitesUs to be relevant and inspiring. 
My hope in writing the book was to encourage dialogue, action, and for others to add their voices and perspectives to our national story. #Steady

I shared this earlier. 
Hope it helps. 
Thank you for your interest. 

If you want any more evidence of how Donald Trump didn‚Äôt want to run against Joe Biden, check out all the effort he and his surrogates are putting into running against Hillary Clinton again in 2020.

A tip of the stetson to my friend @DBtodomundo and his team at @RTB_Cheerful on the launch of a new journalism  project. 
A reason for optimism during this uncertain time. 
#WeAreNotDivided 
#WhatUnitesUs

I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when...

I'm thrilled so many of you want to read WHAT UNITES US. 
I know it's difficult getting copies of the paperback at the moment. 
We're working on it. 
A great option is @Bookshop_Org. 
Added bonus, your purchase helps support local bookstores. 
#WhatUnitesUs.

Thank you for your interest. 
I clicked on the picture and it looks like a seascape in the distance. 
Is #WhatUnitesUs now beach reading? 
Wonders will never cease.

I‚Äôve covered Democratic and Republican presidents.
There were norms, even when they were pushed and stretched. 
What we are witnessing today is unlike anything we have seen before. 
And the press should frame it accordingly.

Can you name another job that Donald Trump would continue to hold after exhibiting this type of unhinged public behavior other than President of the United States with the support of craven and complicit Congressional Republicans?

We are navigating uncharted waters, in almost every way imaginable...

Donald Trump‚Äôs antics are so sad and unhinged that they might have even been disqualifying for a sstint as a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice.

The FBI heroically takes down a domestic terrorist cell seeking to kidnap the Michigan governor. 
Has the president said anything about it?
A potent point.

For those who may be interested, some of my extended thoughts on journalism in our current age. 


Fly. Bye.
If you came in favoring one candidate or the other, I doubt your vote was changed. 
And that‚Äôs likely trouble for the Trump campaign. As political theater, it was mildly interesting. 
But if you were looking for a breakout or something new, you‚Äôre likely disappointed.

It‚Äôs no surprise that the VP wants to duck the climate change crisis. 
So much gaslighting.
‚ÄúThank you VP Pence,‚Äù may not be the best approach for a moderator to cut off a man running amok with a blatant disregard for the debate rules.

I don‚Äôt think VP Pence‚Äôs mansplaining and over-talking is doing a lot to narrow the gender gap, unless it is also turning off more men as well.

Daniel Patrick Moynihan is rolling in his grave as VP Pence uses his quote in the service of lies.
The generations of the future will be gobsmacked that we are ‚Äúdebating‚Äù climate change. 
Many of us are gobsmacked.
And yes, I‚Äôm using gobsmacked, and I stand by that decision.

Pence regularly rolls over his time. Need to enforce rules.
Did Pence just say ‚Äústop playing politics with people‚Äôs lives?‚Äù 
Millions of Americans choke on whatever they‚Äôre eating. Irony has no place on a VP debate stage.

With all due respect, I prefer my fairy tales from Hans Christian Andersen more than VP Pence.
VP Pence having the political equivalence of arguing why the Washington Generals are winning.
Senator Harris not holding back right out of the gate - speaking right into the camera, right into the living rooms of America
Tonight, I expect civility in tone, but a chasm on substance the equivalent of the Grant Canyon.

If Donald Trump still had Michael Cohen working for him today, he would probably send him on a hush money mission to the pollsters at Rasmussen.

So a lot of White House staffers are worried the recklessness of the president will hurt them? 
Welcome to what millions of Americans have been feeling for years.

I hope we can get to a point where the gender of scientists doesn't lead the headlines. 
Yes, women do science. 
They also win Nobel Prizes!!!!! 
#WomenInSTEM


For all of you who woke up worried to see my name trending, thank you for your concern.
I‚Äôm still here with all of you fighting for the decency and justice of our democracy in a spirit of #WhatUnitesUs.

Steady!


Hi Pennsylvania voters - #KnowTheVote

Nothing to feel guilty about.
Hope you enjoy it.
Thanks.
Covid motorcades, signing blank papers, and tear gas walks to a church: the tragedy of Donald Trump‚Äôs photo ops.

For those who may still want to get WHAT UNITES US at the special $1.99 e-book price, the deal will end soon.

Thank you all for the interest and the comments.
I especially appreciate when you highlight passages you find particularly resonant.

#WhatUnitesUs

Nothing says "I work hard" to America more than signing blank sheets of paper.

But the real question is whether it was the same "magical Sharpie" the president uses for his hurricane forecasting.

Was a pleasure to be on @amjoyshow today.
@MariaTeresa1 did a wonderful job filling in as this weekend‚Äôs host.

A nuanced piece of journalism by @RobertKlemko and @GregJaffe.

Context and perspective beyond simplistic headlines and tweets.

More of this please.

Few sights strike deeper into my marrow about the sadness of our times than an empty playground where children should be spending a beautiful afternoon laughing,  hugging, shouting, giggling and playing tag.
 
They will be full again.

I think some of the apparatchiks who issued Kremlin statements during the Cold War would blush at the liberties this White House takes with the truth.

ll those who are going to want to talk about the president‚Äôs ‚Äúnew tone‚Äù should save their energy and just retweet or use what they said similarly from earlier in his presidency.

Thank you.
We are very proud of our #HumanNatureFilm .
I would love to hear what others think of it as well.

Science, the what and how of it, is more important than ever.

Few have so dominated the real estate at 60 feet 6 inches.

Rest In Peace Bob Gibson.

One of the all-time greats.

Apparently the land of make believe about COVID turns out to be... make believe.
Who knew?

Just everyone paying attention to the truth.
On a day of crazy like today, nothing beats listening to Dolly, Loretta, Hank, Waylon, Merle, and Willie.

I have seen a lot in my lifetime.

But for those who have asked, no I have never seen anything quite like this.

No one has.

I would suggest this is well beyond the ability of most reporters‚Äô power of imagination.

If they can‚Äôt keep the White House as safe as the NBA playoffs, how should we trust them to keep the country safe?

One possible explanation for what we are seeing is that Donald Trump hoped he would not have symptoms and thus could keep his COVID diagnosis a secret.

But who knows in a White House with no credibility.

May I suggest a great weekend viewing?

So excited that our documentary #HumanNatureFilm is now streaming on @netflix.

You stay classy, San Diego.

What we don‚Äôt know is a lot more than what we do know.

And we have an administration that long ago squandered its credibility.

All coverage of this crisis should keep these truths in mind for context.

The president‚Äôs health is not purely his own.

It is intertwined with the health and security of the nation.

All who serve the office should also have this reality in mind.

The arts, especially now, must be a big part of #WhatUnitesUs.

This virus is real.

It is contagious.

It is deadly.

Wear a mask.

Social distance.

Wash your hands.

Don‚Äôt be an idiot.

No one has any idea where this story goes from here.

In the next hours, let alone days or weeks.

I pray for everyone‚Äôs health and for the strength and stability of our county in a time of deep turmoil.

I strongly believe we will forge on into a better future.

I hope you liked it enough to continue to Page 2 :)

October surprises will hereafter need to be sorted by date and which episode of the Twilight Zone they most resemble.
 
Good night Twitter.
Can‚Äôt wait to see what insanity and inanity tomorrow will beget.

(Actually I can)

Some things you do in life fill you with a deep pride.
Our documentary #HumanNatureFilm is one of those.

It's about #CRISPR, a science revolution that gives humans  the potential to control our own evolution.

Wow! Please check it out and share with others.

#1 in the entirety of the Kindle store brings a special source of pride because it means people are hopefully going to read what I wrote.

By the way, the $1.99 special price is still available here.

Thank you all.
#WhatUnitesUs

When it comes to covering this administration, I‚Äôm in no mood to play charades.

This is outrageous!
 
Every Texan should have the ability to have their votes cast and counted as safely and conveniently as possible.

Life is a journey, one if you're lucky with many chapters.

Few people have moved through life with the grace of Jimmy Carter, turning 96 today.

Happy Birthday to an indefatigable spirit of optimism, energy, and a belief in the decency of his fellow citizens and global community.

Now #4 on the Kindle charts...

I feel a bit like The Beatles?

Thank you all!
 
When you write a book, you hope it's read.
#WhatUnitesUs

Wow.

Thank you all for skyrocketing the Kindle version of #WhatUnitesUs to #7 in the sales ranking with the $1.99 special price.
(Dreaming of a #1 ranking, as all authors do üòÄ)

Who doesn't like a deal?

There's a special on ebook versions of #WhatUnitesUs.
$1.99!
 
Apparently if enough go out the e-door, algorithms will think it's a book people should hear about.
Shameless self-promotion?
Guilty as charged, but hey it's my Twitter.
I just checked and yes more than 24 hours later the dumpster is still on fire.

I am troubled with the line of reporting that Republicans are ‚Äúdistancing‚Äù themselves from the president‚Äôs racist comments.

Words, as we have seen, are cheap.

Actions, and policy, are what matters.

It's hard to come to grips with a president who embodies the ugliness of the American story.

White supremacy, economic injustice, and entitlement have always lived alongside this nation's most noble ideals.

Perhaps the United States can now reckon with its demons.

They should remain anonymous lest they get a call from the president about a great real estate deal they can invest with him in Azerbaijan.

The more what took place last night sinks in, the more it is clear that Donald Trump is worried about winning this election and his answer is to stoke violent white supremacism and delegitimize the democratic process.

A little bit of nature's beauty for this morning...


There will be an election.

And then there will be a future.

No president is bigger than the nation.

The American people have a voice.
And after tonight, I sense millions are eager to turn their yelling at the television into marking their ballots.

We know bullies.
We know when racists refuse to denounce racism.

We know when autocrats try to undermine democracy.

We need to dig deep into our moral character.
We need to look at ourselves in the mirror and into the hearts of our neighbors and fellow citizens.

We need to embrace a patriotism that is broad, inclusive, and just.

I don't want to hear from the pundits, I want to hear from the people.

I want to hug all of you in a warm embrace and say, we can, we must be a helluva lot better than this.

Who won and lost tonight in a horse race sense, I don't even want to address.

Frankly, I don't give a damn.

This was a sad, sad, sad night for this nation that I love with all my heart.

This is a moment to mourn what we have lost, and are in danger of losing.

America is hurting, really hurting.
Thousands of people are dying every week.

Jobs lost.
Lives thrown asunder.

The West on fire.

Our international standing at the lowest point I can remember.

We need leadership.

We need empathy.

We need unity.

We need justice.

We need hope.

I have seen a lot in my 60-plus years as a reporter.

But I have never seen anything quite like what took place tonight.

Instead of having answers at this point, I am left with one question: Really???

Scariest line all night: ‚ÄúTo be continued...‚Äù

All across America, people are ready to take a shower.
Why do we always come here 
I guess we'll never know 
It's like a kind of torture 
To have to watch the show


More horrific wildfires in California.
My thoughts are with those evacuating and the brave women and men fighting to keep people and property safe.
We cannot afford to ignore the climate crisis.


‚ÄúOh, what a tangled web we weave, When first we practise to deceive!‚Äù
I can see the allure for Donald Trump of living in a rent free house.
But I‚Äôm not sure what his landlords think of the arrangement.
We will know soon enough.

A Potemkin President.
It appears that the real definition of ‚Äúhoax‚Äù is the ‚Äúbusiness mogul‚Äù America saw on The Apprentice.
Bombshell.

Any time a great American city breaks ground on a big new park is a day to celebrate.
It‚Äôs a vote of confidence in the future.
#WhatUnitesUs 

If you haven‚Äôt seen this, there is a reason why this is getting a lot of attention.


You don‚Äôt suddenly become a normal president just because you make a Supreme Court nomination.
So many actions by Trump are marinated in the lies, corruption, and incitement of hatred that define his administration.
And this must be a feature of news coverage on days like today.


I sense a heckuva lot of people are pretty darned committed to voting.
#WhatUnitesUs
I humbly submit this for any who wish to read more about what I have to say.
My conversation with @rhdagostino.

Donald Trump has a long history of throwing his name on things others have built.
It looks like he‚Äôs trying to do that now to Obamacare.
Donald Trump‚Äôs health care ‚Äúplan‚Äù has less meat than a vegan thanksgiving.
Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that the purpose of a coronavirus vaccine is not to inoculate the electorate from his unfitness for office.
It‚Äôs about the health and safety of the American people, something he is supposed to protect and defend.

#KnowTheVote 

Inspiring.


Harold Evans was a superb journalist and editor .
He consistently inspired many of us to try for and maintain high standards.
He will be missed.


This strikes me as puzzling and troubling.


He is not joking.
He doesn‚Äôt joke.
And those who say he is joking know this very well.
This is where we are.
Will any Republican stand up?


When you govern based on facts and science.


A tough, fair interview.
A master class in how to ask questions and demand answers.


Important context from @ezraklein.


Already the number goes higher.
Imagine the empty seats at Thanksgiving dinners.
The missed graduations and basketball games.
The grandchildren never met.
The parent not at a child's weddings.
So much loss.
So much sadness.
So much of it unnecessary.
I weep, and I pray.


I think most Americans know when they are being mugged of their democracy.
If presidential debates don't put the climate crises front and center, they will ignore one of the gravest threats to the health and security of the United States.
If I were Joe Biden, I'd make a point of saying this.
It‚Äôs right on the policy, and I suspect right on the politics.


Don‚Äôt throw away your shot, to have your voice heard on Election Day.


What was it again about that swamp being ‚Äúdrained?‚Äù 

In my @RadioAndySXM broadcast, I want to hear your thoughts.¬†

Dear PENNSYLVANIA voters,
VOTING ‚ÄúNAKED‚Äù is no laughing matter.
It might be the difference in the election.
Please read and share this information.

Few things are more inspiring and hopeful than the energy and determination of student journalists.
The country needs you and we are indebted to you.
