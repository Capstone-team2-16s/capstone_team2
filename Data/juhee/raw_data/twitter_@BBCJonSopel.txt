@realDonaldTrump says at start of rally he is going to kiss all the men in audience
And comes off stage at end dancing to YMCA üòÆ
Now that WOULD be an October surprise

@JoeBiden has said on Monday:
*he is proud to be running for the Senate
*forgot which state he was in (said Pennsylvania; he was in Ohio)
* And forgot Mitt Romney's name
ü§®

He‚Äôs back!

The @realDonaldTrump merch at Sanford Airport doing a good trade, but probably best not to get sticky fingers... 

Dino you said my old school studio in DC made it look like I was announcing a break-in at the Watergate

Ok then.... 

Wow. These are big numbers.... 

Seems the president is going for a tweet marathon this morning. 
Hasn‚Äôt stopped posting in last couple of hours

But he was banned by the administration from appearing on @ABC this morning, when he could have spoken for himself.....ü§î

Small schnauzer world!
Beautiful. 
Thanks re Americast

I'm now wishing the podcast was a hardback book, because this would definitely make the cover: 
'Candour, chemistry and comedy rolled into one'
Thanks Andrew. 
Do I have to share this accolade with @maitlis?

Receiving this has just made me feel incredibly homesick for London and Hampstead Heath. Hiya Alfie...

This is important. 
First major poll since @realDonaldTrump became ill with #Coronavirus  - and shows Biden ahead in Michigan and Nevada and tied in Iowa - but most worrying for White House will be attitudes expressed.....

Words that may come back to haunt @BorisJohnson - Ben Rhodes was deputy National Security Advisor under Obama 

I mean why would you let the public health expert in charge of the fight against the pandemic come on and talk about - err - the fight against the pandemic?

I tell you what, the South Carolina senate race is really one to watch in November. 
Looks like Dem candidate has raised in one quarter more than the total either Labour or Cons spent through whole general election in 2019. 
This in one senate race.


I don‚Äôt think it could happen in UK. 
IMHO parliamentary system provides much more scrutiny. 
We still don‚Äôt know whether President had Covid when he went on stage to debate Biden cos WH won‚Äôt say when he lasted tested negative. 
That‚Äôs inexcusable on every level

Call me sceptical, but this latest statement from @realDonaldTrump physician says  he‚Äôs been ‚Äòfever-free for well over 24 hours.‚Äô 
I thought he‚Äôd been fever free since returning to WH. 
And more importantly, has he tested negative for COVID? 
This doesn‚Äôt say


üò°


Enjoy. Great books...well three of them are....!

Absolutely fair point - in public demonstration there is way more enthusiasm for the president than there is for Joe Biden. 
But it's about what happens at the ballot box - not what happens at rallies and boat parades

Louise...are you trying to kill us!

Exactly. 
One comparison to 2016 and now it is this: in 2016 there were 2 uniquely unpopular candidates and polls were v volatile. 
The remarkable thing about this year is just how consistent they are. 
Doesn't mean they're right. 
But national and state polls do show Biden leading

But every president running for re-election does that. 
You can‚Äôt criticize Donald Trump on that front

The interesting one there is Iowa.
@realDonaldTrump won the state by 10 points in 2016. 
If things were going well, he wouldn‚Äôt be campaigning there with only 3 weeks to go


Many, many congratulations. 
Fabulously well deserved - and please keep up your essential work, which only becomes more important

Very good news....

Statement confirming second #PresidentialDebate  due on 15th is off #Election2020. 
How much money would you bet on the final one taking place a week later?

Really pleased to hear it...hope you‚Äôre enjoying DC
A true gentleman to be with on the road. 
Mr Robbins you will be sorely missed

10 days after confirmation of diagnosis for #coronavirus, @realDonaldTrump‚Å© will be back on the road on Monday....

Love America and best assignment ever reporting on Donald Trump. 
That aside you‚Äôre spot on üôÑ

You clearly haven‚Äôt read the book

Response from UK Department of Health and Social Care after @SpeakerPelosi expresses concern the British have lower standards than #FDA on vaccine approval

1. Not bitter
2. Photographer and film crew were there
3. Head of coast guard was at WH previous Sunday for indoor event for gold star families. 
He then tests positive forcing joint chiefs to self quarantine. 
So linked
#believeinfacts

Thanks for book plug....still available on Amazon

I think they would say here that that would be getting ahead of your skis....

This is bonkers, Paul. 
I got to the White House and saw for first time in ages that marine guard was on duty. 
And posted a picture. 
And because other twitter users make comments, that is my responsibility? 
Do you have any idea how mad this sounds?

So you just can‚Äôt justify the complaint about my tweet, can you?

And you just don‚Äôt have the humility to admit you were wrong to criticise.  
You‚Äôre looking for a definition of contemptuous...

Also if I give you such displeasure just unfollow me. 
It‚Äôs simple

This is absurd. 
You accuse me of anti Trump bias over posting a tweet showing a marine guard outside the West Wing which is totally without comment. 
That‚Äôs it. May I gently suggest the problem is with you, not me. 
You are seeing things not there

I have looked at your tweets, and you bewilder me. Help me understand. 
Show me the error of my ways. 
Tell me anything - I mean anything - biased in the above tweet

You might say that.....
ü§î

Wonder whether he thinks it‚Äôs ‚Äòa blessing from God‚Äô

What you mean reporting what‚Äôs happened?

Interesting. 
The presence of the marine guard outside the West Wing just now means that @realDonaldTrump is working inside the Oval Office

aah the luxury to be able to do that......!

üëèüëèüëè

This is interesting take out from  #VPDebate

Well she was shrply critical over breaking with him on collapsing stimulus talks

Obvious metaphor is rats/sinking ships. 
It's more subtle than that. His prime concern is to keep control of Senate - Trump winning is secondary. 
Seems to me this is @senatemajldr saying to Republicans in tight races if you want to break from Trump and criticise him, you can

This. Is. Exceptional. Unprecedented. 
In essence the normally reliably loyal Republican leader in the Senate @senatemajldr is saying to the president ‚Äòserves you bloody well right‚Äô for catching 
#coronavirus

Woah! This is totally damning from the usually loyal Republican Senate leader, @senatemajldr and will infuriate @realDonaldTrump

Go on, be fly and catch our latest episode

@JoeBiden is in for virtual debate 
#PresidentialDebate

Well maybe there will be NO 2nd presidential debate. Had assumed with Presidential Debates Commission statement they had agreement of both campaigns.... 
#PresidentialDebate

Shall we call it now, and say the likely winner of next week‚Äôs #PresidentialDebate2020 is going to be the mute button?

Just in: 
2nd presidential debate between @JoeBiden and @realDonaldTrump to be virtual and not in person. 
#PresidentialDebate

@KamalaHarris with her Indian and Jamaican heritage looked like she'd been told to go out and play a straight bat to everything.

Does this make me shallow....but given how much there is at stake, I'm thinking this could be, well, a little more engaging, exciting even?

Not like Tottenham at Old Trafford @montie

You get the impression - an unAmerican soccer metaphor - that these are two sides both happy to settle for a 0-0 draw. 
Both circling each other warily. 
Don't want to run down the field and try to score a goal in case they are hit on the counter attack
#VPDebate

Has either person actually answered a question they've been asked yet? 
And has moderator yet said - 'interesting, but that's not what I asked'
#VPDebate

didn't want to introduce this hashtag this soon, but 
#Susangetagrip 
#VPDebate
Susan...get a grip. 
Please
#VPDebate
wow....

In normal circumstances this #VPDebate2020  between @KamalaHarris and @VP would have all the excitement of the World Cup match played between the two losing semi-finalists for third place...but not this election season

Right. enough chat. 
Let's get on with it
#VPDebate2020

‚ÄòA blessing from God‚Äô says the president on catching #coronavirus - which has so far killed 210k Americans. 
He says he now knows how fantastic the drug treatments are, and says every American will get same Regeneron drugs as he did for free. 
Tho doesn‚Äôt say how that will work

Clever...

Lot of tweets like this so far today. 
And last night

That‚Äôs reassuring cos they‚Äôve worked so well until now....


Always have done. 
We presented together years ago. 
Also her twitter handle is @maitlis

no, thank you Ian...
Well I hadn‚Äôt seen that coming....that‚Äôs British irony, btw

This is important. 
Key Dem advisor to Biden told me a couple of months back that overriding strategic goal of campaign is to keep him #Covid free. 
And given current polls, does he need to take risks?

BREAKING: 
Add to that @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs most senior advisor and his speechwriter Stephen Miller has contracted 
#coronavirus

Latest on @WhiteHouse #COVID19 outbreak - more of press team have tested positive. 
@ABC reporting military aide who carries nuclear football has it too. 
And virtually every senior military officer is quarantining after an admiral tested positive - he was at WH event last Sunday

üôè

Definitely the former, with maybe a soup√ßon of the latter...

Emily. 
Great pleasure. 
How you doing?!

Dear brave person who won‚Äôt use a real name, 
It was a joke. 
üôÑ

They‚Äôre pretty annoyed about the White House becoming a Covid hot-spot

Sparrow wars by our @WhiteHouse live position fighting over best spot for a dust-bath

I‚Äôm sure you already have, but if you haven‚Äôt (and if you haven‚Äôt, why not?!) do subscribe to  #Americast with @maitlis and @awzurcher

Amen to that....

Wonder whether @JoeBiden will now be the one demanding a drugs test. 
After course of Dexamethasone, the president‚Äôs probably got more steroids in him than an East German shot-putter...

The last five days in 20 seconds. Genius... 

üòâ
I‚Äôve always wanted to do Soccer Saturday. I think Maitlis and me could nail that 

This is quite a read.... 

Our podcast recorded as @realDonaldTrump left #WalterReedMedicalCenter to return to the White House

'I stood out front, I led. 
Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did. 
I know there's a risk, there's a danger but that's ok.'  
You bet this is his closing argument for the #Election2020

Really?? you sure Nick?? 
Only bad refereeing decisions going against Spurs make me angry

When @realDonaldTrump tweeted don't let #COVID__19 dominate your lives, I guess this is what he meant....

Our reporting tonight on @realDonaldTrump returning to White House and latest on his treatment

Steady. Praise like that will go to my head....
Which sort of raises the question - why was he moved to #WalterReed?

Am sure it's pure coincidence, but 6.30 is when the three nightly news shows  from the networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - go on air

A fair point....

Don‚Äôt be afraid of #COVID19 says the president, even though it has killed over 200,000 Americans so far 

Breaking: 
@realDonaldTrump says he‚Äôll be returning this evening to White House


physician #SeanConley due to brief on @realDonaldTrump condition at top of next hour - 15.00EST, 20.00BST

Thank you. Kind of you to say

It is astonishing to say, but the @WhiteHouse is now the epicentre of a major #covid outbreak, begging so many questions about their protocols and safety measures. 
Kayleigh briefed reporters - as recently as yesterday - without a mask

BREAKING: 
president's press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, has tested positive for #Coronavirus. 
She briefed us on Thursday without a mask - and again without a mask on Friday following the president's diagnosis


Someone‚Äôs got his voice back....


Good pedantry.

I like pedantry.

And correct usage.

Thank you

Dr Phillips is a Covid-19 expert and attending physician at #WalterReed 

This is @realDonaldTrump supplemental oxygen tonight: the cheers of the crowd.

My report while it happened outside #WalterReedMedicalCenter

Unbelievable scene outside #WalterReed 
- @realDonaldTrump has just driven past slowly to wave at his supporters
üòâ

üí§ üí§ üõè

The flapping of the men in white coats....

Both excellent for radio...

Our latest...and recorded this morning before latest medical briefing 

Woah. This is big.

Though taken after debate and before @realDonaldTrump was taken ill.
I think the polling among seniors is also really interesting - a demographic Trump won in 2016

This is so joyous....

Latest medical bulletin on @realDonaldTrump - key quote ‚Äòwhile not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic‚Äô

You‚Äôre kidding, right?

Video message from the president at #WalterReed this evening

Goodness.
Hope all is ok....

ü§î

Lot of support for @realDonaldTrump outside #WalterReedMedicalCenter where he‚Äôs being treated for #coronavirus

Clarification from @WhiteHouse physician on 72 hours from diagnosis statement.

How can this have been handled so clumsily?

Really astonishing

So why not just say?

This is the extraordinary letter released by @realDonaldTrump physician pre-2016 election, suggesting that Mr Trump might have had a hand in writing it.

Not inconceivable that president has told his physician today what he could and couldn‚Äôt say over receiving oxygen

Unbelievable - so the 'source' for the statement that president's vitals being 'very concerning' 
I'm going to guess is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff - seen here briefing my colleagues, straight after the press conference by @realDonaldTrump  physician

In the name of openness and transparency, please @WhiteHouse @PressSec answer these two questions:
When was @realDonaldTrump first diagnosed with #coronavirus, or when was last negative result?
Has the president received supplemental oxygen?
This needs clarifying

This is crazy.

Very important addition to this.
This is a senior WH ‚Äòsource‚Äô who has said this to ALL the pool reporters who are at Walter Reed.

So at same time as dr is saying one thing, a senior official is painting a v different picture.

Why would you do that?

This is a very different picture than one painted by @realDonaldTrump physician 

During the 72 hour timeline given by physician, @realDonaldTrump held a press briefing with no mask, flew to Duluth for rally, went to Bedminster for a fund raiser where no one wore masks.

If @WhiteHouse knew he was symptomatic/had #coronavirus isn‚Äôt that indefensible?

My big take out from that briefing - the physician talked about the last 72 hours.
What?
Confirmation only came yesterday morning from @realDonaldTrump
 - so did he have #coronavirus on Wednesday, and WH chose not to disclose it?

 Seems a fair question


#SeanConley 
the physician to @realDonaldTrump is giving a lawyer‚Äôs answers about being given oxygen, not a doctor‚Äôs....

‚ÄòHe‚Äôs not received any Oxygen today,‚Äô says @realDonaldTrump physician - but yesterday?
He seemed to deflect that answer

#SeanConley says we‚Äôre ‚Äòextremely pleased‚Äô at progress @realDonaldTrump is making

State of the art monitoring was reason to go to Walter Reed says @realDonaldTrump physician.

BreKing: ‚Äòthe president is doing very well‚Äô says his physician Sean. Inlet

Are we the super-gifted younger brother?

I don‚Äôt think so.
Briefings often run late.
But on something so important, why announce a time and then not stick to it

This....


Ha Aileen.
I would post a selfie, but I look so bloody ragged....

Useful reminder from @BarackObama.

And it needs saying: 
‚ÄúObviously, we‚Äôre in the midst of a big political battle right now, and while there‚Äôs a lot at stake, let‚Äôs remember that we‚Äôre all Americans.

We‚Äôre all human beings.

And we want everyone to be healthy, no matter our party."

Just confirmed - Update on @realDonaldTrump health will be given by his physician Sean Conley in an hour‚Äôs time

Spectacular
Add Republican Senator Ron Johnson

About the #SuperSpreader #SCOTUS event last Saturday at the @WhiteHouse, best comment 
I‚Äôve read is that it‚Äôs made Democrats believe in God, and Republicans believe in science....

Thanks Matt...

Add to that Chris Christie - just confirmed as well

None!


You‚Äôre very kind.
What a week....

In last 24 hours as well as @realDonaldTrump  &amp; FLOTUS we've had positive tests on:
2 republican senators
Kellyanne Conway
Trump campaign manager
Head of RNC
3 WH correspondents
This hasn't happened at some overcrowded meat packing plant, but the WH where they've been cavalier

President receiving Remdesivir - but not requiring supplemental oxygen, according to latest bulletin from WH physician

President walking from the White House unaided on his way to helicopter to take him to #WalterReed Medical Centre

Very important point - @WhiteHouse is stressing that @realDonaldTrump going to #WalterReed will not involve temp transfer of power to @VP, as per Article 25 of the constitution.
‚ÄòThe President remains in charge‚Äô is the message

üëç

BREAKING.
@realDonaldTrump about to be flown from White House to Walter Reed Medical Centre ‚Äòas a precaution‚Äô.

This has strong echoes of the trajectory @BorisJohnson - precautionary move etc

Our latest #Americast on a dramatic and troubling 18 hours 
#coronavirus 
#TrumpHasCovid

BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump chief of staff, Mark Meadows, says president is showing mild symptoms of #coronavirus, but is in good spirits

All events have been cleared from @realDonaldTrump schedule - except this one:
He is going ahead with a conference call on #coronavirus and how it affects vulnerable seniors.....
Really

First comment from Biden: https://t.co/QSs11jOABt

Oh piss off you clown.
And it‚Äôs through.
Not trough

An historical document, and only an hour or two old.

The confirmation of @realDonaldTrump diagnosis from White House physician of #coronavirus

02.00 and  woken by Bureau Chief with news that @realDonaldTrump has #coronavirus - which is simultaneous stonishing - given all the testing.

And not at all surprising, given blas√© attitudes towards mask wearing in the White House.

Wishing the POTUS, FLOTUS and Hope well

This is sadly ironic

So what does this mean?
Are all rallies canceled?
Does he quarantine for two weeks - all the time you could be incubating the virus?

If so, that means there won‚Äôt be a second #PresidentialDebate2020 in Florida.

BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump says "I just went for a test and we'll see what happens." 
He is awaiting results for coronavirus test after close aide, Hope Hicks who travelled on Marine One and AF1 with POTUS yesterday tests positive.

Says he doesn't know yet about self-quarantining

48 hours after creating a firestorm over refusing to condemn white supremacists #ProudBoys, and after the far right group used the president's words as a recruiting and marketing tool, @realDonaldTrump goes on #Hannity on #Fox to say this

So Saturday we had #AmyConeyBarrett  
Sunday the New York Times @realDonaldTrump  tax bombshell, 
Monday the aftermath, 
Tuesday the #PresidentialDebate, 
Wednesday #ProudBoy-gate, 
Now this...just another quiet 5 days in #TrumpLand 
Apologies if I've missed anything

üëÄ

I think that‚Äôs an unfair question to ask Mr Zurcher - he won‚Äôt know who Noel Edmonds is.
And he probably thinks crinkly bottom is something you treat with a soothing cream....

Don't wish to be harsh - but wasn't everyone a loser in this debate - particularly American democracy?
The idea that there is any talk of winning 'big' after Tuesday's car crash  might be seen as a bit tone deaf #PresidentialDebate2020

Thanks Joe...

Sue main thing is you don‚Äôt have to watch it.

It‚Äôs a podcast.
But never mind.
Have a nice day

I know sounds logical.

But what if @realDonaldTrump campaign don‚Äôt agree - and feel pretty certain they won‚Äôt.

The president doesn‚Äôt want it to be sedate

You‚Äôd expect me to say this...but I think this is a really good listen.

And interviews with a couple of undecided voters post debate are super interesting....
if you haven‚Äôt subscribed do join us @maitlis and @awzurcher


Brilliant!


Breaking - statement from Debates Commission on last night‚Äôs shitshow, and calling for further measures to ensure orderly #Debates2020 - but new measures meaningless unless candidates adhere

And thanks Gordon!
 Hope you enjoy new episode which should be up soon

Good question.
Yes he does have to pay for it if it‚Äôs purely a campaign stop.
But obviously advantageous to have AF1 as your backdrop when you rock up for a rally in an aircraft hangar

Cos I‚Äôm in Ohio for debate, and Arizona is a bit of a schlep for a vox pop
they were interesting.

A lot said Biden had done way better than they‚Äôd expected.

Hadn‚Äôt anticipated Trump supporters would say that.

Campaign set bar so low for him that he jumped it easily

This was biggest Trump ‚Äòwatch party‚Äô in Ohio last night in a town called Strongsville (sic) - and moment I walk in with my mask on, a guy comes up (not in photo), and says to me ‚Äòyou loser,‚Äô pointing at the mask. ü§∑‚Äç

#debates


Hmm...

üò¨

The morning after the night before.
#ChrisWallace is taking a kicking from liberal media for not being tough enough with @realDonaldTrump, and from the right for being in the pocket of the Dems.

Seems unfair on both counts.

#NoWin  

#Debates2020 
#PresidentialDebate2020

You do realise the Proud Boys have now changed their logo to incorporate the president's words?

They are saying it was an historic night for them thanks to @realDonaldTrump, and are boasting of new recruits as a result.

You clearly don't watch much Fox...
Fox and Friends?
Tucker? Judge Jeanne? Hannity? 
Do I need to go on.....

This....


Tune in to #Americast later today where @maitlis @awzurcher and I will try to make sense of the first #PresidentialDebate2020 
#debates

This was @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs best moment of the night
 #debates #PresidentialDebate2020
 
ü§î

Have just returned from a bar fifteen miles outside Cleveland at a watch party where there were about a 1000 @realDonaldTrump supporters.

Surprising take out?

Grudging acknowledgement @JoeBiden had done better than they‚Äôd expected.


#debates 
#PresidentialDebate2020

This is a straightforward challenge to @nytimes reporting - the paper says @realDonaldTrump paid  $750 in 2016 and 2017 in federal income tax.
The president says he paid millions
Let‚Äôs see documents 

#PresidentialDebate 
#Debates2020

One thing for the president to go after a CNN or MSNBC presenter, but a Fox anchor

#Debates2020 
#PresidentialDebate2020

‚ÄúWill you shut up, man?‚Äù Says @JoeBiden exasperated at the constant heckling from @realDonaldTrump 
- can this level of talking over each other continue for next 70 minutes?
I think I know the answer #Debates2020

@JoeBiden needs to stop laughing derisively, @realDonaldTrump needs to stop snarling, particularly at host
#Debates2020

This is like start of FA Cup final before they sing Abide With Me - all nerves and anticipation #PresidentialDebate2020

I think premature evacuation of your pending mail...

And again....

Fabulous light in #Cleveland ahead of #PresidentialDebate2020

üòâ

Yikes....

Yeah but you can never be sure when  there‚Äôs a 95th minute penalty awarded #COYS üôÑ

When a hospital becomes a military base.
The scene in #Cleveland ahead of tonight‚Äôs  #PresidentialDebate2020

Yes we‚Äôve reported on claims of that.

Georgia???!!! üòØ

Can that be true???

Is this boxing‚Äôs equivalent of the weigh-in trash talking?

#PresidentialDebate2020

Who needs sleep?
Stay up and watch...and maybe invite all your friends over.

Oh hang on.

Scratch the last bit


Hang on.
This is problematic.

Last night: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs totally fake news.
Made up.
Fake.‚Äù
Today: ‚Äúillegally obtained information‚Äù
Which is it?

This is why the @nytimes #DonaldTrumpTaxes story might well resonate - it is not some call with a Ukrainian leader about military aid  and investigations into an obscure gas company.
This is very easy to understand to anyone who pays income tax in the US

But will it make a difference....?


But of course...
#2020worstyear 

Incredible @nytimes story.
The year @realDonaldTrump became president and was listed as a billionaire by Forbes he paid just $750 in income tax.
And killer line from report: ‚ÄòTrump has been more successful playing a business mogul than being one in real life‚Äô

My report tonight on #SCOTUS 
- Joe Biden says Supreme Court nomination is a ‚Äúthreat to democracy‚Äù


This is amazing.
Well worth finding the time for.
Blood Lands is bloody fantastic 


This really does boggle the mind: that in the midst of a deadly pandemic, protestors are clashing with police - over the pandemic - resulting in injuries on both sides

Sorry.
Still gives me shivers.....


Good summary, if you want a quick digest of where #AmyConeyBarrett stands on the big issues
#SCOTUS 

The 'compare and contrast' quotes from Lindsey Graham really are quite something


So awful and so shocking.
And thank goodness it is so shocking.
Sadly here in the US, police being shot - or police shooting suspects - is an everyday occurrence.


Looking forward to it (he smiles nervously...) 

So not from Queens, New York then? ü§î 

Ouch.


I think latest @foxnewsalert polls are not going to go down well at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 

Great work from Donie at CNN  what price facts?
what price truth? 

You probably know this, but our latest pod is up.
Would love to hear your views on the two congressional candidates @maitlis and I interview - one Republican, one Democrat.
Also latest on #RBG 

A reminder from a different time and a different century.

He won‚Äôt have liked this - not one little bit.
#RBG 

No wonder @realDonaldTrump wants to get ride of this FBI Director as well...he just doesn‚Äôt get the narrative.


Whoa.
Just now from @realDonaldTrump on #MeghanMarkle -  "I'm not a fan of hers, and  would say this....I wish a lot of luck to Harry, because he's gonna need it.‚Äù

I do hope we didn‚Äôt swear.

Sorry, but isn‚Äôt it a bit Dad‚Äôs Army to have to stop and do your shoe laces up?
Wonder whether he‚Äôs Private Pike.


It‚Äôs tightening.

But not a whole lot of social distancing.


Oh @maitlis - that is joyous!
 Thank the lord he wasn‚Äôt in Kent 
This is where it is deeply uncomfortable: 
Total US deaths = 200k. 
Global deaths =965k. 
US deaths represent 20%. plus plus of total US share of world population = 4%.
Therefore 5x more deaths relative to pop'n.
How is that an A+?
