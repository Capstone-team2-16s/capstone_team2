My blog on what is going to happen in this election. 
And it is crystal clear
#Election2020
Thanks for saying so. 
And thanks for teaching this really important stuff to your students, with such obvious enthusiasm. 
Great that you do
good luck to you all...
let's compare notes afterwards...
maybe over a glass of something that has an amber colour 
My work is complete. 
In this extraordinary campaign I have come across my first #labradonald at the @realDonaldTrump rally in 
#Scranton 
#Election2020
I think his outfit is a bit 2016 tbh. 
#BuildTheWall 
#Scranton 
#Election2020
Kind of interesting - and maybe sad - that the Elders thought it was necessary to put this tweet out
#Election2020
Understand @WhiteHouse is planning for @realDonaldTrump to hold indoor party for approx 400 guests in East Room on election night
#COVID19 
#Election2020
I am done. Toast. 
Finished. It’s over. 
I give up now. 
She is the future. 
I am the past. 
This is who @huwbbc and @sophieraworth should be putting on the news tonight
#Election2020 
#thestarsarealigned
America’s top  infectious disease expert who has served 6 presidents now in the political cross-hairs and a slogan at @realDonaldTrump rallies. 
How he must hate that his lifesaving work has become politicised 
#Election2020
Lol
This could be a big selling Christmas game....
Normally in back row, three seats in...
Glad I packed warm clothes for @realDonaldTrump rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania today. 
Brrr 🥶 
#Election2020
Latest polling from Pennsylvania, the key battleground in this election.
@realDonaldTrump held 4 rallies here on Saturday, and has another today. 
@JoeBiden is holding 3 events in the state today. 
#Election2020
A question I can’t believe hasn’t been raised: 
if @MichelleObama is the greatest asset the Democrats have - popular, respected, able to reach parts of electorate others struggle with - 
why has she been invisible these last 4 weeks? 
Not a single rally or event
#2020Election
Thank you Cathryn. 
I think we could wish for no greater compliment...but 18 episodes??? 
You need to get out more
Is that good or bad? 
Actually don’t answer. 
I think I can tell you’re from the wrong bit of N London
Am trying...but failing
Is that just a case of a ref who couldn’t bear to admit that he made the wrong decision? 
Incredible #COYS
From the pool reporter travelling with @KamalaHarris just now - was there ever a venue more aptly named for covering a lengthy presidential election campaign?
#Election2020
Thanks so much....
Fine piece of writing by the brilliant @maureendowd on what she ses at stake in this election 
Am I really not allowed to deploy an eye roll emoji here? 
Final key state polls now from @nytimes and Siena College. 
Similarly optimistic to yesterday’s CNN polls. 
If you’re the @JoeBiden camp you are going to dare to dream
#Election2020
So interesting....
‘That’s what i do,’ says @BarackObama as he drains a three-pointer 
#Election2020 
#toocoolforschool
I should have added, but sure you know this, these are all states @realDonaldTrump won in 2016
Final set of state polls from @CNNPolitics just released. Biden at 50% or higher in all four is significant.
#Election2020
While UK focuses on #Lockdown2 update on US: 
Nearly 100k infections yesterday - one day record
Deaths have topped 230k
47 states are seeing cases surging
16 states have cases at all time high
No new measures though
#Election2020
Oy. Watch it...
😉
I am. 
But feeling the pain for my family and friends and everyone who’ll be affected so harshly
Admire your multitasking skills of balancing - and almost simultaneous - tweets on #LIVWHU and #Lockdown2
What. A. Dismal. Saturday. 
#Lockdown2
#sopeldidntgetany
???
This is nuts. 
This is the only place where mass audience events are happening in the US
Greatly saddened about death of #SeanConnery. 
A little bit of Sopel family history: 
My first cousin Carol had been engaged to him in the 1950s after they'd appeared in South Pacific together - but cos he wasn't Jewish it had to end, causing her great pain. 
#differenttimes
Fascinating but surely wrong. 
Neither party is behaving as though the numbers are anything like this in PA or FLA
#Election2020
If you want a really clear read on @JoeBiden path to victory on Tuesday and the different routes he can take, and what @realDonaldTrump needs to do to maintain power this is v good #Election2020
Thank you Frances. Exactly. 
I go and pick Maitlis up from the airport and Anthony gets the Revels
Thanks Phil. 
Like Arnie in Terminator ‘we’ll be back....’
A doctor writes....
Sure. Wasn’t making comparison. 
Difference is that @EmmanuelMacron isn’t facing a general election in four days time. 
@realDonaldTrump is
🙏- and couldn’t agree more re Hugh. 
Lovely man too
Were they any good? 
Asking for a friend....
Made my day too. 
Definite name check soon for the 10 year old - and an Americast pencil (if we had such a thing...)
‘Will no one rid me of this troublesome doctor...’
Sorry to bang on about Texas - but more people have voted early in the Lone Star state than the total who cast a ballot in 2016. 
That either suggests polling stations are going to have their quietest day ever on Tuesday, or turnout is going to smash 2016's levels
#Election2020
Hard to overstate how closely @realDonaldTrump follows the Dow, and sees its rise and fall as a barometer of the US economy. 
These numbers will really hurt
Not what @realDonaldTrump would have scripted for final week of the campaign:
Coronavirus cases soaring to record highs, with deaths rising
The Dow having its worst week since March
#Election2020

This is interesting...so @realDonaldTrump more likeable than he was four years ago - but for @JoeBiden, more likeable and it's the % that are likely voters that  Dems will find most encouraging
Thank you James- so kind of you to say so. 
Have a good weekend
Fair enough
Forgot to say, there’s a bonus additional bit at the end of #Americast - after the music - that’s worth the price of admission alone. 
@WilfredFrost on the podcast he’s doing of his father’s famous interviews - got to listen to clip of Joe Biden from 1987. Uncanny
Bruce. 
I owe you an apology. 
If you are running five miles in a little over half an hour, then I am humbled....
Just seen you said 5 miles. I’m going to shut up now 🤫
Bruce - don’t want to be rude mate, but how long do you need for a 5k? 
@maitlis and I saunter round 5k in around 20 mins 🤥 (if I’m allowed a cheeky emoji 😳)
When a candidate tweets about what they’re NOT going to do doesn’t it look defensive? 
Doesn’t it suggest the @realDonaldTrump attacks are hitting the target?
#Election2020
What? Not another #Americast??  
Next you’ll be saying it’s with those same clowns @maitlis @awzurcher and Sopel…
wasn't she great? 
And Ryan the week before who'd decided on Trump, equally interesting and compelling
Aside from the content of this tweet, which requires a bit of unpacking (If Biden wins, it's because of my Supreme Court?)...look at the time it was sent - 02.57.
Oooh. Good question!
This is incredible from Texas. 
Total of 8.5 million people voted in the state in 2016 
Early voting so far  is just 400k shy of that - and five days to go til polling day. 
#Elections2020
😳
If you ever wanted a fast rebranding exercise that would shout 'UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT' this is it
#Corbyn
#TheBoss takes on The Donald. 
But this time four years ago he played for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia, and that didn't do a whole lot. 
Do interventions like this make any difference? 
#Election2020
“With the fake news, everything is #COVID19, Covid, Covid, Covid,” says @realDonaldTrump - it's rounding the turn, it's going away. 
And here's America's lead infectious disease expert. 
Has there ever been such a jarring disjunction between politics and science? 
#Election2020
Something went wrong STEVE....
Aah. Thanks Kate 😉
Thanks Gareth...
I think the production team on the doc did a phenomenal job
Steve. 
Appreciate it
Thanks Simon...
Great question. 
There was concerted effort to change in 1960s - but it requires a constitutional amendment. 
And threshold is high for that. 
And although there was strong bipartisan support it was filibustered by 3 segregationist senators from the South
Thanks Sam....
Hi Jazz. 
No!  
We’ll be back on Friday....
That’s me, @Maitlis and @awzurcher for you - latest episode available now of  #Americast 
wow...Colonel Mustard, with the lead piping, in the library? 
is another way of putting it
@Maquaver I’m hearing you....
I’d take Wednesday, and then if no resolution throw a sicky on Thursday. 
And if it goes on for weeks, you may have to quit your job 😉
My report from #Georgia on state of the race for #Election2020 
Listen carefully to the band as Joe Biden comes onto stage....
Haha. A pleasure Sima. 
There’s a subliminal bit of Midnight Train to Georgia on the Ten in a few mins....so you can play that later #neverknowinglyundercliched
This is fascinating. 
Tell me why you think it i… https://t.co/eXd7aQJnGg
For dessert....
Yep. 
And they’re really not.....
I did on the road four years ago at a drag racing event. 
Never again
That’s dinner sorted 
#Georgia
Aah that is a lovely thing to write Nina. 
Most of what I scribble is pure nonsense....congrats on getting the business gig on @BBCBreakfast
Statement from @realDonaldTrump campaign on @JoeBiden campaign stop here in Georgia....
It’s always the third party candidates that cause confusion 
#Election2020
US has reported 500,000 new cases in past week
And numbers admitted to hospital are up 15% in last week
#COVID19
Thanks for retweeting a photo I took two years ago
Amazing there have been any constitutional amendments give how high the bar is set for getting them passed...
And now at dusk
🙏
Off beam. 
The  single Storey building is where the briefing room is, which in turn,  is built on what was the indoor swimming pool. 
At the back is the famous colonnade. 
This building links the East and West wing. 
See below....
Perfect autumn evening @WhiteHouse - what a privilege it is to do this job (mostly...)
I saw you mention Maitlis and me. 
I saw you mention Maitlis and me. 
I saw you saying what utter beauty...and I put two and two together. 
You were talking about us, right?


Cos that worked so well when she was introduced 😳
#SuperSpreaderEvents 
#SupremeCourtConfirmation
#coronavirus
If this is as you state it, it is disgraceful, and hope the full force of law is brought against those responsible. 
The glory of democracy and freedom of speech is people can express their views without fear of attack - whether Jews for Trump or Jews for Biden. 
No ifs or buts
Trump team believe they’re seeing a re-run of 2016. 
All down to sprint for line. 
But, but, but - some v big diffs between now and then and early voting numbers are astonishing
Fabulous.... 
This will lift @realDonaldTrump campaign spirits...
This ain’t done...
#Election2020 
Whaaaaat the......? 
#Adele brilliant on #SNL last night. 

As if the world wasn’t divided enough....
Does that translate as: ‘I may be the @VP and head of the @WhiteHouse #coronavirus task force, but there’s an election to fight so will be ignoring the guidelines I’ve asked the rest of the American people to follow?’
Detail in this poll is interesting... 
When rhetoric flies in face of reality: 
@realDonaldTrump has just said at rally in NC: "We're rounding the turn. 
Our numbers are incredible." 
Yesterday #coronavirus stats:
85,000 new cases - worst day on record
41,000 in hospital
900+ deaths
How is this turning corner?
These numbers are amazing #Election2020 
For my sins I’m a Spurs supporter - and last Sunday when we were 3-0 up against West Ham with 8 mins left, I would have said we had victory wrapped up......
Oh bloody thanks Maitlis. 
Just woken up. 
And see that cheap jibe. 
Well only one way to test it - subscribe now...
For the record I like to think of myself as the shy, modest, diffident type 🤥
TBH surprised the drop isn’t  sharper given the first #Debates2020 mess. 
Still a huge number though
@robertmooreitv Haha. 
Cut piece this morning. 
Did podcast and flew....
Band sound-checking. 
Incredible sky. 
Some residual warmth in air. 
#Georgetown 
you look really pretty tonight 
My report on last night’s #Debates2020 https://t.co/SdoFnrb74x via @YouTube
I think a quick health warning needed about this episode. 
@awzurcher disses #JaffaCakes and #TheArchers - 
I think he will need a security detail next time he comes to the UK...that is, if he’s allowed in #ShameOnZurch
Thanks David...
Latest episode of #Americast just done....with @maitlis and @awzurcher
Phew......
Departing the stage from #Debates2020 last night 
😳 
Good mention or bad mention? 
Asking for a friend.....
Arguably  greatest achievement of his presidency are these peace deals signed with Israel, which are hugely noteworthy. 
And yet haven’t featured so far, and will probably shift few votes in #Election2020
She’s always ticking me off...
And only 11 days away.....
Yes
Yes
Hi Peter - hope you enjoy. 
And sincerely h… https://t.co/rBiPRO4FZ6
One other shout out tonight from #Debates2020 - 
I thought @HCAhealthcare in Nashville did a stunning job on #covid testing for all of us who needed access to debate site. 
Brilliantly well organised, and a model of how we can get back to some normality pre-vaccine
And the winner of tonight’s debate was.....
Great job. 
And equally tough on both men
#KudostoKristen
Have just come back from a #Debates2020 watch party that @realDonaldTrump supporters had organised. 
Apparently 3 weeks ago for 1st debate it was rammed. 
About 15 people there tonight. 
Will be interesting to see if that’s reflected in TV viewing figures
@realDonaldTrump arguing that the kids separated from their parents at the border 'are being looked after so well' is a pretty extraordinary claim to make. 
They have been made orphans by US policy 
#Debates2020
you will be smashed if you drink a shot every time Biden says 'malarkey'
Genuine questions
What does it mean to say your bank account in China is listed?
What does pre-paying your income tax mean?
#Debates2020
The shouting has been replaced by grimaces, mock laughter, eye rolls that would make an amateur dramatics ham blush - but infinitely preferable to Cleveland
#Debates2020
"what are you hiding?" 
@JoeBiden says to @realDonaldTrump over his tax returns. 
#Debates2020
interesting observation 
Early, I know. 
But @kwelkernbc is presiding over an illuminating and much more thoughtful debate that the American people will appreciate #KudostoKristen 
#Debates2020
do you think @JoeBiden and @realDonaldTrump have got written on their hands 'remember to be polite and do not shout?' 
#Debates2020
"I take full responsibility," says @realDonaldTrump over #coronavirus before very fast pivoting away and blaming China 
#Debates2020
There is a strangely sullen atmosphere between @realDonaldTrump and @JoeBiden in #Debates2020 - no shouting, as if they are still exhausted from the fight they had last time
very bullish about the prospects for vaccine 
#Debates2020
"I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries by what we've been able to do," says @realDonaldTrump over his handing of #coronavirus. 
would be genuinely interested to know which. 
#Debates2020
@kwelkernbc looking composed and poised as she greets the First Lady and Dr Jill Biden - seeming to show no nerves. 
#Debates2020
No but those V-twin engines make a lovely noise
This is just the motorcycle part of the convoy ferrying @realDonaldTrump in #Nashville ahead of #Debates2020 
Remarkable thing about this is that 3 weeks ago he was prepping @realDonaldTrump for first debate. 
Now ahead of final #Debates2020 bemoaning stupidity of not wearing a mask. 
Not so subtle attack on president’s policies
And we’ll be recording another podcast tomorrow post-debate 
Am struck by the very down beat tone of the president at start of this interview. 
Much less pugilistic. 
Much less swagger. 
Seems fed up before interview even begins
Well said.. 
Cricket ball/long grass
“magnificently brilliant” 😳 
???????😳😳😳 
This....  
#revelinginherdiscomfort 
Hake news...
Oh Rudy....this does not read well 
Pleasure. 
Hope you enjoy the night. 
Remember Florida is key to on the night reporting
Fair point....
do you remember our incisive student journalism??
@realDonaldTrump will like this....
Good question Hasan. 
The assumption, and I stress assumption, is that big turnout early helps the Dems- but that might all be nullified by big turnout on day for Trump. 
So dangerous to draw too many conclusions
Hey - have a great night. 
When I was a journalism student it was me and @steverichards14 commentating on the eckham by-election! 
Glad to see you guys are starting with the most consequential presidential election in decades
Huge lines of people voting early here in Nashville, Tennessee for #Election2020. 
So far 36 million Americans have already voted - that’s more than a quarter of total turnout in 2016 - and still nearly two weeks to polling day
In a sophisticated, 1st world country, this is horrifying. 
It is one thing to separate mothers from their hildren - and people will have their own views on that - but to do so without the necessary paperwork and bureaucratic measures so they later can be reunited is shameful
???
👏👏👏👏👏 
Odd.... 
Is Electrolux a brand here...?
Encouraging.... 
Wow... 
First Lady @FLOTUS had been due to attend her first rally of campaign with @realDonaldTrump but has pulled out, citing ill health - her spokeswoman saying tho she feels better there's 'a lingering cough, and out of an abundance of caution, she will not be traveling today.'
Take that....
#Fauci hits back
What is so obnoxious about this is that before boarding it is made clear that EVERYONE has to wear a mask. 
If passenger objects, s/he shouldn’t have got on. 
But instead is delaying everyone else 🙄
And @realDonaldTrump campaign response to new #Debate2020 rules..... 
Key par in statement from the #Debate2020 commission. 
I think this is less draconian than @realDonaldTrump campaign feared, and doesn’t go as far as some others were demanding

Is this normal? 
Exxon releasing statement like this? 
Am I right in thinking back in January he complimented her on landing a weekend show, telling her ‘They made a very wise decision.’??
the numbers who've already voted in #Elections2020 are incredible. 
25 million so far (that's about 20% of total who voted 4 years ago)
still not convinced the final #Debates2020 will take place 
Wonder whether this shows strength or vulnerability. 
Iowa? N Carolina?
@realDonaldTrump goes after #DrFauci in campaign call with staff, saying "People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots....he's been here 500 years" 
Risky strategy: polls have shown Fauci far more trusted on #covid  than the president

Am confused about the messaging here. 
So is @JoeBiden the senile old man who can't find his way back from the bathroom unaided, or the criminal mastermind of Ernst Blofeld proportions? 
'Aah Mr Trump we were expecting you....'
Lauren, i think you need help....let me put it another way...who needs #Americast when you have pubs...?
Glad you found us....
Lawyers. Lots and lots of lawyers. 
And then maybe the Supreme Court. 
In 2000 I think I’m right in saying 36 days went by post-election before George W was declared the winner
Dear Jock McBritish, Yes, and in same programme I say he's a brilliant politician, with a visceral sense of the mood of the American people, and knows how to tickle it. 
I also say you under-estimate him at your peril. 
But yeah, you go ahead and ignore that
Laaleen....thank you so much. 
Glad you enjoyed! 
I think we might have more to say between now and the election...
Her dressing room is DEFINITELY bigger than mine
Excellent...thanks for writing Stuart
And playing it for laughs. 
Wonder  how that is going to work out in Georgia where the Republicans are facing an unusually tough fight. 
Wonder how much his Dem rival @ossoff is going to raise in 💵 off back of this
Jennie. 
That means a lot - particularly as my son lives there too. 
Tough time to be so far away
Like really soon....
Just emerged from a hot, sweaty edit suite...the latest #Americast with @maitlis and @awzurcher and me
I think the effect of listening back to Biden last night 😉
From this evening #Americast with @maitlis in London and @awzurcher in Washington will  have moving pictures as well as sound. 
Just getting ready to roll in Miami....
I’m sure I have never uttered a word like that...
My diary for today’s Evening Standard
4 big takeouts from @realDonaldTrump #NBCTrumptownhall 
1. can't say whether he was #covid tested on day of first debate
2. seemed to confirm @nytimes reporting on both $750 income tax & $400M debt
3. wouldn't condemn #QAnon
4. didn't mention #HunterBidenEmails at all
Hmm
wear masks - ambivalent
Denounced white supremacy - 48 hours AFTER 1st debate
Transfer of power - refused to say in WH briefing room
pre-existing conditions - yes, but how?
Covid relief bill - nearly scuppered by unilateral announcement to pull plug on talks
I suspect @realDonaldTrump will be furious with the way this is going. 
He's been on defensive with sharp questioning from 
@SavannahGuthrie. 
She has conversational yet tough style of questioning. 
Stand out topics: covid, his personal taxes, QAnon - not where he wants to be
??????????? 
Not an aggressive question, but how does @realDonaldTrump say he's created 160 million jobs? 
Isn't that more or less the entire US workforce? 
Suggests there was virtually 100% unemployment 
#NBCTrumptownhall
'I have heard many different stories on masks,' says @realDonaldTrump 
- every health official advising the WH says where a mask
OMG from @SavannahGuthrie 'you're the president you're not like somebody's crazy uncle' 
#NBCTrumptownhall
@realDonaldTrump says he doesn't know anything about #QAnon and says it is good they are against paedophilia. 
But he says he knows about #antifa
Given salience of this issue, given persistent questions about whether the president got tested on day of  debate, given the questions posed to the WH physician, I'm saying by now we should be able to have a clearer answer than 'possibly I did, possibly I didn't'
Thanks Matt....
Above the @realDonaldTrump boat parade, a light aircraft is towing a Trump/Putin banner!!
That was not a great choice of word. 
Sorry. 
Tremor better?
If I wink once.... 😉 
you know what to do
Bet this has sent a shiver through the @JoeBiden campaign 
About to set sail with boaters and voters for @realDonaldTrump in Miami
As a matter of course @maitlis @awzurcher and I try not to do humility. 
But bloody hell. 
Number 2 in the overall Apple podcast charts for UK?  
Thanks so much guys for all the support/feedback/questions for #Americast
Coming soon.....
They were...!
Leo. He could. 
Think precedent for that is Grover Cleveland, America’s 22nd and 24th président at end of 19th century
Only just seen this, but it  has made me roar with laughter 
Clearly we didn’t spend long enough at #TheVillages - or maybe we did, on second thoughts..... 
From our latest pod....
🧐
🤐🤐🤐🤐🤫🤫🤫🤫🤭🤭🤭🤭
I think this is set to become the improbable soundtrack to #Election2020 
A song that opens with the words ‘young man’ for the 74 and 77 year old candidates (and that’s leaving aside the rest of the lyrics....!)
Am sure the person in the Trump creative team thought this was clever. 
But did anyone stop to think whether it’s smart? 
Old people shd not be punchline to joke. 
They’re essential to the president’s re-election
🙏
He won’t like being compared to low energy Jeb! 
To all the people who say 'but you can't trust the polls,' this is a really interesting read on what is being done to try to get them right in #Election2020
Latest from @maitlis @awzurcher and me on race for Florida- a sunshine state special (try saying that after 4 Margaritas). 
Also a brilliant, brilliant undecided voter
Extra. Extra. Hear all about it. 
Latest from @maitlis @awzurcher and me. 
The title does not refer to either Anthony or me....
Must say hadn’t guessed the Asian bit from his name. 
Must take real courage to be so direct when you’re using a pseudonym
This is an amazing animation of politics and the pandemic in the US, and how nearly all worst affected states are now Republican 
#USElection2020
Cheers Ian.
We do it all the time
@awzurcher will correct me if I’m wrong, but outgoing president plays no constitutional role in proceedings. 
The oath of office is done by Chief Justice. 
Also what if President dies in office, like JFK? 
Ex pres more important for symbolism of peaceful transfer of power
Surprised the poll finding isn’t just under 100%..... 


@realDonaldTrump says at start of rally he is going to kiss all the men in audience
And comes off stage at end dancing to YMCA 😮
Now that WOULD be an October surprise

@JoeBiden has said on Monday:
*he is proud to be running for the Senate
*forgot which state he was in (said Pennsylvania; he was in Ohio)
* And forgot Mitt Romney's name
🤨

He’s back!

The @realDonaldTrump merch at Sanford Airport doing a good trade, but probably best not to get sticky fingers... 

Dino you said my old school studio in DC made it look like I was announcing a break-in at the Watergate

Ok then.... 

Wow. These are big numbers.... 

Seems the president is going for a tweet marathon this morning. 
Hasn’t stopped posting in last couple of hours

But he was banned by the administration from appearing on @ABC this morning, when he could have spoken for himself.....🤔

Small schnauzer world!
Beautiful. 
Thanks re Americast

I'm now wishing the podcast was a hardback book, because this would definitely make the cover: 
'Candour, chemistry and comedy rolled into one'
Thanks Andrew. 
Do I have to share this accolade with @maitlis?

Receiving this has just made me feel incredibly homesick for London and Hampstead Heath. Hiya Alfie...

This is important. 
First major poll since @realDonaldTrump became ill with #Coronavirus  - and shows Biden ahead in Michigan and Nevada and tied in Iowa - but most worrying for White House will be attitudes expressed.....

Words that may come back to haunt @BorisJohnson - Ben Rhodes was deputy National Security Advisor under Obama 

I mean why would you let the public health expert in charge of the fight against the pandemic come on and talk about - err - the fight against the pandemic?

I tell you what, the South Carolina senate race is really one to watch in November. 
Looks like Dem candidate has raised in one quarter more than the total either Labour or Cons spent through whole general election in 2019. 
This in one senate race.


I don’t think it could happen in UK. 
IMHO parliamentary system provides much more scrutiny. 
We still don’t know whether President had Covid when he went on stage to debate Biden cos WH won’t say when he lasted tested negative. 
That’s inexcusable on every level

Call me sceptical, but this latest statement from @realDonaldTrump physician says  he’s been ‘fever-free for well over 24 hours.’ 
I thought he’d been fever free since returning to WH. 
And more importantly, has he tested negative for COVID? 
This doesn’t say


😡


Enjoy. Great books...well three of them are....!

Absolutely fair point - in public demonstration there is way more enthusiasm for the president than there is for Joe Biden. 
But it's about what happens at the ballot box - not what happens at rallies and boat parades

Louise...are you trying to kill us!

Exactly. 
One comparison to 2016 and now it is this: in 2016 there were 2 uniquely unpopular candidates and polls were v volatile. 
The remarkable thing about this year is just how consistent they are. 
Doesn't mean they're right. 
But national and state polls do show Biden leading

But every president running for re-election does that. 
You can’t criticize Donald Trump on that front

The interesting one there is Iowa.
@realDonaldTrump won the state by 10 points in 2016. 
If things were going well, he wouldn’t be campaigning there with only 3 weeks to go


Many, many congratulations. 
Fabulously well deserved - and please keep up your essential work, which only becomes more important

Very good news....

Statement confirming second #PresidentialDebate  due on 15th is off #Election2020. 
How much money would you bet on the final one taking place a week later?

Really pleased to hear it...hope you’re enjoying DC
A true gentleman to be with on the road. 
Mr Robbins you will be sorely missed

10 days after confirmation of diagnosis for #coronavirus, @realDonaldTrump⁩ will be back on the road on Monday....

Love America and best assignment ever reporting on Donald Trump. 
That aside you’re spot on 🙄

You clearly haven’t read the book

Response from UK Department of Health and Social Care after @SpeakerPelosi expresses concern the British have lower standards than #FDA on vaccine approval

1. Not bitter
2. Photographer and film crew were there
3. Head of coast guard was at WH previous Sunday for indoor event for gold star families. 
He then tests positive forcing joint chiefs to self quarantine. 
So linked

Thanks for book plug....still available on Amazon

I think they would say here that that would be getting ahead of your skis....

This is bonkers, Paul. 
I got to the White House and saw for first time in ages that marine guard was on duty. 
And posted a picture. 
And because other twitter users make comments, that is my responsibility? 
Do you have any idea how mad this sounds?

So you just can’t justify the complaint about my tweet, can you?

And you just don’t have the humility to admit you were wrong to criticise.  
You’re looking for a definition of contemptuous...

Also if I give you such displeasure just unfollow me. 
It’s simple

This is absurd. 
You accuse me of anti Trump bias over posting a tweet showing a marine guard outside the West Wing which is totally without comment. 
That’s it. May I gently suggest the problem is with you, not me. 
You are seeing things not there

I have looked at your tweets, and you bewilder me. Help me understand. 
Show me the error of my ways. 
Tell me anything - I mean anything - biased in the above tweet

You might say that.....
🤔

Wonder whether he thinks it’s ‘a blessing from God’

What you mean reporting what’s happened?

Interesting. 
The presence of the marine guard outside the West Wing just now means that @realDonaldTrump is working inside the Oval Office

aah the luxury to be able to do that......!

👏👏👏

This is interesting take out from  #VPDebate

Well she was shrply critical over breaking with him on collapsing stimulus talks

Obvious metaphor is rats/sinking ships. 
It's more subtle than that. His prime concern is to keep control of Senate - Trump winning is secondary. 
Seems to me this is @senatemajldr saying to Republicans in tight races if you want to break from Trump and criticise him, you can

This. Is. Exceptional. Unprecedented. 
In essence the normally reliably loyal Republican leader in the Senate @senatemajldr is saying to the president ‘serves you bloody well right’ for catching 
#coronavirus

Woah! This is totally damning from the usually loyal Republican Senate leader, @senatemajldr and will infuriate @realDonaldTrump

Go on, be fly and catch our latest episode

@JoeBiden is in for virtual debate 
#PresidentialDebate

Well maybe there will be NO 2nd presidential debate. Had assumed with Presidential Debates Commission statement they had agreement of both campaigns.... 
#PresidentialDebate

Shall we call it now, and say the likely winner of next week’s #PresidentialDebate2020 is going to be the mute button?

Just in: 
2nd presidential debate between @JoeBiden and @realDonaldTrump to be virtual and not in person. 
#PresidentialDebate

@KamalaHarris with her Indian and Jamaican heritage looked like she'd been told to go out and play a straight bat to everything. 
Don't try and hit the ball to the boundary. 
Don't swing wildly outside the off stump
#VPDebates2020

If only @VP had done that

caught on the fly. 
Or fly caught on the Pence

Most exciting thing to happen so far is that @VP seems to have a very black fly stuck in his very white hair

#VPDebate
In the name of....
Please, please #SusanPage say 'but that is not an answer to my question'

Hope you credit...!
😉

Does this make me shallow....but given how much there is at stake, I'm thinking this could be, well, a little more engaging, exciting even?

Not like Tottenham at Old Trafford @montie

You get the impression - an unAmerican soccer metaphor - that these are two sides both happy to settle for a 0-0 draw. 
Both circling each other warily. 
Don't want to run down the field and try to score a goal in case they are hit on the counter attack
#VPDebate

Has either person actually answered a question they've been asked yet? 
And has moderator yet said - 'interesting, but that's not what I asked'
#VPDebate

didn't want to introduce this hashtag this soon, but 
#Susangetagrip 
#VPDebate
Susan...get a grip. 
Please
#VPDebate
wow....

In normal circumstances this #VPDebate2020  between @KamalaHarris and @VP would have all the excitement of the World Cup match played between the two losing semi-finalists for third place...but not this election season

Right. enough chat. 
Let's get on with it
#VPDebate2020

‘A blessing from God’ says the president on catching #coronavirus - which has so far killed 210k Americans. 
He says he now knows how fantastic the drug treatments are, and says every American will get same Regeneron drugs as he did for free. 
Tho doesn’t say how that will work

Clever...

Lot of tweets like this so far today. 
And last night

That’s reassuring cos they’ve worked so well until now....


Always have done. 
We presented together years ago. 
Also her twitter handle is @maitlis

no, thank you Ian...
Well I hadn’t seen that coming....that’s British irony, btw

This is important. 
Key Dem advisor to Biden told me a couple of months back that overriding strategic goal of campaign is to keep him #Covid free. 
And given current polls, does he need to take risks?

BREAKING: 
Add to that @realDonaldTrump’s most senior advisor and his speechwriter Stephen Miller has contracted 
#coronavirus

Latest on @WhiteHouse #COVID19 outbreak - more of press team have tested positive. 
@ABC reporting military aide who carries nuclear football has it too. 
And virtually every senior military officer is quarantining after an admiral tested positive - he was at WH event last Sunday

🙏

Definitely the former, with maybe a soupçon of the latter...

Emily. 
Great pleasure. 
How you doing?!

Dear brave person who won’t use a real name, 
It was a joke. 
🙄

They’re pretty annoyed about the White House becoming a Covid hot-spot

Sparrow wars by our @WhiteHouse live position fighting over best spot for a dust-bath

I’m sure you already have, but if you haven’t (and if you haven’t, why not?!) do subscribe to  #Americast with @maitlis and @awzurcher

Amen to that....

Wonder whether @JoeBiden will now be the one demanding a drugs test. 
After course of Dexamethasone, the president’s probably got more steroids in him than an East German shot-putter...

The last five days in 20 seconds. Genius... 

😉
I’ve always wanted to do Soccer Saturday. I think Maitlis and me could nail that 

This is quite a read.... 

Our podcast recorded as @realDonaldTrump left #WalterReedMedicalCenter to return to the White House

'I stood out front, I led. 
Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did. 
I know there's a risk, there's a danger but that's ok.'  
You bet this is his closing argument for the #Election2020

Really?? you sure Nick?? 
Only bad refereeing decisions going against Spurs make me angry

When @realDonaldTrump tweeted don't let #COVID__19 dominate your lives, I guess this is what he meant....

Our reporting tonight on @realDonaldTrump returning to White House and latest on his treatment

Steady. Praise like that will go to my head....
Which sort of raises the question - why was he moved to #WalterReed?

Am sure it's pure coincidence, but 6.30 is when the three nightly news shows  from the networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - go on air

A fair point....

Don’t be afraid of #COVID19 says the president, even though it has killed over 200,000 Americans so far 

Breaking: 
@realDonaldTrump says he’ll be returning this evening to White House


physician #SeanConley due to brief on @realDonaldTrump condition at top of next hour - 15.00EST, 20.00BST

Thank you. Kind of you to say

It is astonishing to say, but the @WhiteHouse is now the epicentre of a major #covid outbreak, begging so many questions about their protocols and safety measures. 
Kayleigh briefed reporters - as recently as yesterday - without a mask

BREAKING: 
president's press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, has tested positive for #Coronavirus. 
She briefed us on Thursday without a mask - and again without a mask on Friday following the president's diagnosis


Someone’s got his voice back....


Good pedantry.

I like pedantry.

And correct usage.

Thank you

Dr Phillips is a Covid-19 expert and attending physician at #WalterReed 

This is @realDonaldTrump supplemental oxygen tonight: the cheers of the crowd.

My report while it happened outside #WalterReedMedicalCenter

Unbelievable scene outside #WalterReed 
- @realDonaldTrump has just driven past slowly to wave at his supporters
😉

💤 💤 🛏

The flapping of the men in white coats....

Both excellent for radio...

Our latest...and recorded this morning before latest medical briefing 

Woah. This is big.

Though taken after debate and before @realDonaldTrump was taken ill.
I think the polling among seniors is also really interesting - a demographic Trump won in 2016

This is so joyous....

Latest medical bulletin on @realDonaldTrump - key quote ‘while not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic’

You’re kidding, right?

Video message from the president at #WalterReed this evening

Goodness.
Hope all is ok....

🤔

Lot of support for @realDonaldTrump outside #WalterReedMedicalCenter where he’s being treated for #coronavirus

Clarification from @WhiteHouse physician on 72 hours from diagnosis statement.

How can this have been handled so clumsily?

Really astonishing

So why not just say?

This is the extraordinary letter released by @realDonaldTrump physician pre-2016 election, suggesting that Mr Trump might have had a hand in writing it.

Not inconceivable that president has told his physician today what he could and couldn’t say over receiving oxygen

Unbelievable - so the 'source' for the statement that president's vitals being 'very concerning' 
I'm going to guess is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff - seen here briefing my colleagues, straight after the press conference by @realDonaldTrump  physician

In the name of openness and transparency, please @WhiteHouse @PressSec answer these two questions:
When was @realDonaldTrump first diagnosed with #coronavirus, or when was last negative result?
Has the president received supplemental oxygen?
This needs clarifying

This is crazy.

Very important addition to this.
This is a senior WH ‘source’ who has said this to ALL the pool reporters who are at Walter Reed.

So at same time as dr is saying one thing, a senior official is painting a v different picture.

Why would you do that?

This is a very different picture than one painted by @realDonaldTrump physician 

During the 72 hour timeline given by physician, @realDonaldTrump held a press briefing with no mask, flew to Duluth for rally, went to Bedminster for a fund raiser where no one wore masks.

If @WhiteHouse knew he was symptomatic/had #coronavirus isn’t that indefensible?

My big take out from that briefing - the physician talked about the last 72 hours.
What?
Confirmation only came yesterday morning from @realDonaldTrump
 - so did he have #coronavirus on Wednesday, and WH chose not to disclose it?

 Seems a fair question


#SeanConley 
the physician to @realDonaldTrump is giving a lawyer’s answers about being given oxygen, not a doctor’s....

‘He’s not received any Oxygen today,’ says @realDonaldTrump physician - but yesterday?
He seemed to deflect that answer

#SeanConley says we’re ‘extremely pleased’ at progress @realDonaldTrump is making

State of the art monitoring was reason to go to Walter Reed says @realDonaldTrump physician.

BreKing: ‘the president is doing very well’ says his physician Sean. Inlet

Are we the super-gifted younger brother?

I don’t think so.
Briefings often run late.
But on something so important, why announce a time and then not stick to it

This....


Ha Aileen.
I would post a selfie, but I look so bloody ragged....

Useful reminder from @BarackObama.

And it needs saying: 
“Obviously, we’re in the midst of a big political battle right now, and while there’s a lot at stake, let’s remember that we’re all Americans.

We’re all human beings.

And we want everyone to be healthy, no matter our party."

Just confirmed - Update on @realDonaldTrump health will be given by his physician Sean Conley in an hour’s time

Spectacular
Add Republican Senator Ron Johnson

About the #SuperSpreader #SCOTUS event last Saturday at the @WhiteHouse, best comment 
I’ve read is that it’s made Democrats believe in God, and Republicans believe in science....

Thanks Matt...

Add to that Chris Christie - just confirmed as well

None!


You’re very kind.
What a week....

In last 24 hours as well as @realDonaldTrump  &amp; FLOTUS we've had positive tests on:
2 republican senators
Kellyanne Conway
Trump campaign manager
Head of RNC
3 WH correspondents
This hasn't happened at some overcrowded meat packing plant, but the WH where they've been cavalier

President receiving Remdesivir - but not requiring supplemental oxygen, according to latest bulletin from WH physician

President walking from the White House unaided on his way to helicopter to take him to #WalterReed Medical Centre

Very important point - @WhiteHouse is stressing that @realDonaldTrump going to #WalterReed will not involve temp transfer of power to @VP, as per Article 25 of the constitution.
‘The President remains in charge’ is the message

👍

BREAKING.
@realDonaldTrump about to be flown from White House to Walter Reed Medical Centre ‘as a precaution’.

This has strong echoes of the trajectory @BorisJohnson - precautionary move etc

Our latest #Americast on a dramatic and troubling 18 hours 
#coronavirus 
#TrumpHasCovid

BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump chief of staff, Mark Meadows, says president is showing mild symptoms of #coronavirus, but is in good spirits

All events have been cleared from @realDonaldTrump schedule - except this one:
He is going ahead with a conference call on #coronavirus and how it affects vulnerable seniors.....
Really

First comment from Biden: https://t.co/QSs11jOABt

Oh piss off you clown.
And it’s through.
Not trough

An historical document, and only an hour or two old.

The confirmation of @realDonaldTrump diagnosis from White House physician of #coronavirus

02.00 and  woken by Bureau Chief with news that @realDonaldTrump has #coronavirus - which is simultaneous stonishing - given all the testing.

And not at all surprising, given blasé attitudes towards mask wearing in the White House.

Wishing the POTUS, FLOTUS and Hope well

This is sadly ironic

So what does this mean?
Are all rallies canceled?
Does he quarantine for two weeks - all the time you could be incubating the virus?

If so, that means there won’t be a second #PresidentialDebate2020 in Florida.

BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump says "I just went for a test and we'll see what happens." 
He is awaiting results for coronavirus test after close aide, Hope Hicks who travelled on Marine One and AF1 with POTUS yesterday tests positive.

Says he doesn't know yet about self-quarantining

48 hours after creating a firestorm over refusing to condemn white supremacists #ProudBoys, and after the far right group used the president's words as a recruiting and marketing tool, @realDonaldTrump goes on #Hannity on #Fox to say this

So Saturday we had #AmyConeyBarrett  
Sunday the New York Times @realDonaldTrump  tax bombshell, 
Monday the aftermath, 
Tuesday the #PresidentialDebate, 
Wednesday #ProudBoy-gate, 
Now this...just another quiet 5 days in #TrumpLand 
Apologies if I've missed anything

👀

I think that’s an unfair question to ask Mr Zurcher - he won’t know who Noel Edmonds is.
And he probably thinks crinkly bottom is something you treat with a soothing cream....

Don't wish to be harsh - but wasn't everyone a loser in this debate - particularly American democracy?
The idea that there is any talk of winning 'big' after Tuesday's car crash  might be seen as a bit tone deaf #PresidentialDebate2020

Thanks Joe...

Sue main thing is you don’t have to watch it.

It’s a podcast.
But never mind.
Have a nice day

I know sounds logical.

But what if @realDonaldTrump campaign don’t agree - and feel pretty certain they won’t.

The president doesn’t want it to be sedate

You’d expect me to say this...but I think this is a really good listen.

And interviews with a couple of undecided voters post debate are super interesting....
if you haven’t subscribed do join us @maitlis and @awzurcher


Brilliant!


Breaking - statement from Debates Commission on last night’s shitshow, and calling for further measures to ensure orderly #Debates2020 - but new measures meaningless unless candidates adhere

And thanks Gordon!
 Hope you enjoy new episode which should be up soon

Good question.
Yes he does have to pay for it if it’s purely a campaign stop.
But obviously advantageous to have AF1 as your backdrop when you rock up for a rally in an aircraft hangar

Cos I’m in Ohio for debate, and Arizona is a bit of a schlep for a vox pop
they were interesting.

A lot said Biden had done way better than they’d expected.

Hadn’t anticipated Trump supporters would say that.

Campaign set bar so low for him that he jumped it easily

This was biggest Trump ‘watch party’ in Ohio last night in a town called Strongsville (sic) - and moment I walk in with my mask on, a guy comes up (not in photo), and says to me ‘you loser,’ pointing at the mask. 🤷‍
#PresidentialDebate2020 
#debates


Hmm...

😬

The morning after the night before.
#ChrisWallace is taking a kicking from liberal media for not being tough enough with @realDonaldTrump, and from the right for being in the pocket of the Dems.

Seems unfair on both counts.

#NoWin  

#Debates2020 
#PresidentialDebate2020

You do realise the Proud Boys have now changed their logo to incorporate the president's words?

They are saying it was an historic night for them thanks to @realDonaldTrump, and are boasting of new recruits as a result.

You clearly don't watch much Fox...
Fox and Friends?
Tucker? Judge Jeanne? Hannity? 
Do I need to go on.....

This....


Tune in to #Americast later today where @maitlis @awzurcher and I will try to make sense of the first #PresidentialDebate2020 
#debates

This was @realDonaldTrump’s best moment of the night
 #debates #PresidentialDebate2020
 
🤔

Have just returned from a bar fifteen miles outside Cleveland at a watch party where there were about a 1000 @realDonaldTrump supporters.

Surprising take out?

Grudging acknowledgement @JoeBiden had done better than they’d expected.


#debates 
#PresidentialDebate2020

This is a straightforward challenge to @nytimes reporting - the paper says @realDonaldTrump paid  $750 in 2016 and 2017 in federal income tax.
The president says he paid millions
Let’s see documents 

#PresidentialDebate 
#Debates2020

One thing for the president to go after a CNN or MSNBC presenter, but a Fox anchor

#Debates2020 
#PresidentialDebate2020

“Will you shut up, man?” Says @JoeBiden exasperated at the constant heckling from @realDonaldTrump 
- can this level of talking over each other continue for next 70 minutes?
I think I know the answer #Debates2020

@JoeBiden needs to stop laughing derisively, @realDonaldTrump needs to stop snarling, particularly at host
#Debates2020

This is like start of FA Cup final before they sing Abide With Me - all nerves and anticipation #PresidentialDebate2020

I think premature evacuation of your pending mail...

And again....

Fabulous light in #Cleveland ahead of #PresidentialDebate2020

😉

Yikes....

Yeah but you can never be sure when  there’s a 95th minute penalty awarded #COYS 🙄

When a hospital becomes a military base.
The scene in #Cleveland ahead of tonight’s  #PresidentialDebate2020

Yes we’ve reported on claims of that.

Georgia???!!! 😯

Can that be true???

Is this boxing’s equivalent of the weigh-in trash talking?

#PresidentialDebate2020

Who needs sleep?
Stay up and watch...and maybe invite all your friends over.

Oh hang on.

Scratch the last bit


Hang on.
This is problematic.

Last night: “It’s totally fake news.
Made up.
Fake.”
Today: “illegally obtained information”
Which is it?

This is why the @nytimes #DonaldTrumpTaxes story might well resonate - it is not some call with a Ukrainian leader about military aid  and investigations into an obscure gas company.
This is very easy to understand to anyone who pays income tax in the US

But will it make a difference....?


But of course...
#2020worstyear 

Incredible @nytimes story.
The year @realDonaldTrump became president and was listed as a billionaire by Forbes he paid just $750 in income tax.
And killer line from report: ‘Trump has been more successful playing a business mogul than being one in real life’

My report tonight on #SCOTUS 
- Joe Biden says Supreme Court nomination is a “threat to democracy”


This is amazing.
Well worth finding the time for.
Blood Lands is bloody fantastic 


This really does boggle the mind: that in the midst of a deadly pandemic, protestors are clashing with police - over the pandemic - resulting in injuries on both sides

Sorry.
Still gives me shivers.....


Good summary, if you want a quick digest of where #AmyConeyBarrett stands on the big issues
#SCOTUS 

The 'compare and contrast' quotes from Lindsey Graham really are quite something


So awful and so shocking.
And thank goodness it is so shocking.
Sadly here in the US, police being shot - or police shooting suspects - is an everyday occurrence.


Looking forward to it (he smiles nervously...) 

So not from Queens, New York then? 🤔 

Ouch.


I think latest @foxnewsalert polls are not going to go down well at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 

Great work from Donie at CNN  what price facts?
what price truth? 

You probably know this, but our latest pod is up.
Would love to hear your views on the two congressional candidates @maitlis and I interview - one Republican, one Democrat.
Also latest on #RBG 

A reminder from a different time and a different century.

He won’t have liked this - not one little bit.
#RBG 

No wonder @realDonaldTrump wants to get ride of this FBI Director as well...he just doesn’t get the narrative.


Whoa.
Just now from @realDonaldTrump on #MeghanMarkle -  "I'm not a fan of hers, and  would say this....I wish a lot of luck to Harry, because he's gonna need it.”

I do hope we didn’t swear.

Sorry, but isn’t it a bit Dad’s Army to have to stop and do your shoe laces up?
Wonder whether he’s Private Pike.


It’s tightening.

But not a whole lot of social distancing.


Oh @maitlis - that is joyous!
 Thank the lord he wasn’t in Kent 
This is where it is deeply uncomfortable: 
Total US deaths = 200k. 
Global deaths =965k. 
US deaths represent 20%. plus plus of total US share of world population = 4%.
Therefore 5x more deaths relative to pop'n.
How is that an A+?
