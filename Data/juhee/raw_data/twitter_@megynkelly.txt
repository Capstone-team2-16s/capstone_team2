I think this is good for us as a people!
Class act @TheRealSambora responds to Jon Bon Jovi. 
An amazing THREAD ⬇️ and one that rightly gives credit to @JaniceDean for leading the way on holding  Cuomo accountable for his recklessness. 
How dare he celebrate his “leadership” on COVID?
WORTH YOUR TIME ⬇️⬇️
TGIF people 💕 Thunder 
Biden sounds good/coherent on ABC right now - talking about the country’s future/unity - has the “aw shucks” attitude he sometimes shows.
It’s definitely easier when the moderator lets you speak.
Trying to get excited by this town hall on ABC but confess — I’m struggling. You?
Yes
Seriously? 
Spoken like a man who’s never had a criminal running at him with a deadly weapon.
So far, this is not a town hall for voters, it is designed to appease the angry NBC employees/Dems who are pissed off Trump’s on NBC at all.
More masks! 
How many Q’s can we do on masks?
Wait - they knew they had an audience member asking a mask Q and they still spent 5 mins on masks pre-audience?
Yes! 
Good Q! 
How are you going to get the economy back on track. 
Leave it to the ER doc - no nonsense.
What on earth is happening with these Q’s?
This is already much better for Trump than the last debate.
Good for Trump for fighting back on this white supremacy Q - the 10,000th one.
Scully seems like a nice guy but C-SPAN did the right thing. 
Contrast w/MSNBC &amp; its host who made up a fake hacking to excuse her bigoted blog posts re LGBT+.

AGAIN. 
“Potentially harmful...”
Check out my latest episode with @AlanDersh.  
We covered the backlash he felt supporting Trump during impeachment, I asked him if he thought Jeffrey Epstein killed himself and whether or not he thinks OJ is guilty. 
Tune in to find out:
Insane ppl are attacking @maggieNYT for tweeting out this article, calling her a Trump hack. 
Grow up, Blue Checks. 
Love you too JD. 
You are a force for good in this world.
“Please, please like me” is actually a pretty fun, funny, and self-deprecating way of connecting. 
This is why so many ppl forgive Trump his jagged edges - he can laugh at himself.


Honestly - can our KIDS JUST GO TO SCHOOL????? 
I think this is the most personal I’ve gotten in an interview. 
@adamcarolla and I “went there” ... and then some. Appreciated the great talk.
-Comm’n on Pres. Debates really botched this. 
Had no right to unilaterally change debate to virtual. 
Should try hard to resurrect in-person debate.
-Also: if Trump is COVID-free, we need to hear it from someone other than Conley, who lied to us repeatedly.
Kids are sitting at home not able to go to school for others’ protection and ... this.
  Sick of this B.S. 
Oh sweetheart, you should unfollow me bc I have a lot to say.
Happy Columbus Day!
“Columbus Day is a time to remember that that which seems impossible rarely is. 
It is a day to...ask yourself what challenges you can face with strength and purpose.”
No they aren’t. 
Football and baseball have done just fine. 
Why don’t you take a look at what Adam Silver just said about political messages in the NBA before you try to lecture others.
So many ppl feel this way. 
They got political and the fans left in droves. 

How do you look this good at 37 weeks?
You look amazing!!

Also thx to the media which pours gasoline on any and every spark he ignites - no matter how big or small, all are treated like a 5-alarm fire.
Well said @JoeConchaTV
I interviewed @RealCandaceO for a wide-ranging interview on President Trump and how she came to support him, victimhood, racism in America, motherhood & more.
Listen, download, subscribe & review here:
They can’t possibly go with this. 
How stupid do they think we are? 
This is insane. 
This cannot suffice.

Just dropped our latest episode of the @MegynKellyShow  - post VP debate analysis with @charlescwcooke, @krystalball, & @esaagar -check it out!

It’s not my job to “support” her, &amp; it’s not sexist to critique her.

He wasn’t demeaning her. 
He was making a point on policy.
Monster?
Is he *trying* to lose? 

How dare you compare my tweet, suggesting Kamala woman-up (meaning be her strongest, composed self) make less faces while Pence is speaking to a man who sexually abused, harassed & hurt so many women?

Ppl have lost their minds. 
I address on my podcast dropping later today.
Yes.
Sure, b/c absolutely no one criticized Trump for his behavior at the last debate. 
Commission on Pres. 
Debates announces (unilaterally, apparently) that next debate will be VIRTUAL. 
Trump: “Pathetic,” and NO. 
We won’t attend.
It’s there now!

Download “The Megyn Kelly Show” on your podcast app and hear my full reaction along w/ analysis from my panel tomorrow!
Holy Lord. 

Maddow: 
“Pence tried to steamroll Harris and the moderator and instead he looked (again) flaccid” ... 
N Wallace: “he looked limp and lame.” 
Steamroll? Limp & lame? 
Good Lord the hatred is overwhelming.

Nicole Wallace: 
“VP Pence appeared flaccid.”
 Omg I’m done.
Joy Reid saying Mike Pence interrupted continually and every woman knows what it is like to have that happen over and over - 
she was “momala” in that woman and it was very bad for Donald Trump.

Gayle King: 
“it was very telling that a fly landed on Mike Pence’s head when he was denying America’s systemic racism. 
The fly was like ‘say whaaat?’” 😳
Is anyone else wondering why we haven’t seen Pence more in this campaign?
Very nice answer by Pence to Brecklyn on Ginsburg &amp; Scalia and how “America always comes together.” 
Answer of the night.
Pence: 
“I think we’re going to win this election.”
Harris: 
“VOTE. Pls vote.”
Pence: 
“When Joe Biden was VP, the FBI actually spied on our campaign”
The fly is free and now getting a COVID test
Omg Susan Page needs to tell him
#flygate!
Does he have a fly on his head??
Pence: 
“Biden’s belief that law enforcement have an implicit bias against minorities is a great insult.”
Pence: 
“I trust our justice system.”
She won’t answer. 
Re court packing. Good on Pence for pointing it out.
The “I’m speaking, *I’m* speaking” thing worked at first. 
Now it’s getting old.
Pence: 
“The American ppl deserve an answer: are you and Biden going to pack the Supreme Court?”
No
Harris: 
“Biden and I are ppl of faith and it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith.” 
Media/Dems... ummm ... 
she doesn’t speak for us Handmaiden!

Pence on Amy Coney Barrett’s Catholicism: 
Don’t go there.
Pence: 
“Joe Biden opposes the raid on Osama Bin Laden!”
Pence: 
“these slanders are absurd.”
This is Harris at her strongest. 
(Re Trump and military)
Pence: 
“we destroyed the ISIS caliphate.”
Harris making the Iran deal sound like a fun campfire w/s’mores we were all enjoying until evil orange man ruined it.
Harris: 
“Trump has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world” 
Here we go on For Policy...
“There’s a weird obsession that Trump has had with getting rid of anything accomplished by Obama” FACT.
Is anyone else starting to fade?
This is so calm, soothing. 
The Smooth Jazz debate.  
Not like the “Get Off My Lawn” 
Debate last week.
China! Drink!
Pence: 
“lost the trade war with China?? 
Joe Biden never fought it.” 
Good counterpoint.
Harris: 
“you lost that trade war (with China). 
You lost.” 
Strong, simple. Check.

Instead of “like a man.” We can be stoic too
Take it like a woman. 
Don’t make faces.
Omg the head shake.
So far Susan Page doing a nice job.
Ok Karen. 
“Reigned over?”
Don’t smirk. 
Don’t shake your head. 
Don’t smile mockingly. Wait.

“There was a time when our country believed in science.” 
(Was it the time they said Covid would skip the BLM protesters?)

Pence projects “gentleman.” 
Tough to dislike. 
So far Kamala looks professional, calm. 
Should stop the head shaking.
Pence: same!
Page: have you and Biden had The Incapacitation Talk? 
Harris: dodges: 
I was the first female DA in my district and getting chosen as VP nom was wonderful.
Pence: 
“Stop playing politics with ppl’s lives -your continued undermining of confidence in a vaccine is unacceptable.”
Harris with good rebuttal - you failed to provide them with the truth to make those decisions
Pence: 
“We trust the American ppl to make choices about their health. 
We are about freedom.”
Pence is so much better than Trump at defending Trump
The plan is contact tracing?
This literally made me lol
Looking forward to this! 
See you in a few @scrowder!
Looking forward to it!

I don’t think media should be circulating the Claudia Conway postings. 
The family is obviously struggling w/a tough… 

I’ve tweeted about my friend @JoelleCosentino &amp; her amazing dance company thru which she was training &amp; empowering… 

Woah. 


nails it.

That “idea” has hurt and killed a lot of people.


I love, love, love this talk with @adamcarolla about cancel culture.

Man speaks the truth!
 

Listen here: https://t.co/kRCgbwqZMk

I know Richie, and he most definitely has his life together.

Happier than he’s ever been.
This is who @TheRealSambora is, and he very much “has his act together,” @jonbonjovi, as you well know.
“How Richie Sambora Helped Megyn Kelly's Son After Teacher's Death”

“There's not a day that goes by that I don't wish that Richie had his life together… 
In a weird way, it's because of his inability to get it together anymore that we went on and wrote This House Is Not For Sale.”

What a low-class attack on the guy who made you a star, Jon Bon Jovi.

@TheRealSambora is the most genuine, kind, giving friend, dad, human there is.

No one has a bad word re: him-except you, always you.

Guess you need att’n for your new album?

Sad.

“Subject” is very strong for any song by America.


Stop that right now.

For me it was my mom, Blondie, and “The Tide is High.”
P.s. Is Katie real?

Surely she’s trolling us with “putting a leash on a dog” is subjugation as is buckling a child seat”?

Dear Men: Katie doesn’t speak for us.
Dear Katie: being a strong woman doesn’t mean shaming men for common courtesy.

Some of us absolutely love it.

So much easier!


I actually hadn’t clicked thru to the article and I should have.

It’s just another “Trump is awful” piece - not one celebrating his possible death.

My bad - looks like WAPO actually only meant to tweet out its latest hate piece on Trump, which basks in how wonderful it would be if he loses, not dies.

The fact that you think this tweet, from the Washington Post,  was just fine if one buys that they didn’t know Trump had COVID when they sent it is further proof of your blinding hatred when it comes to DT, Tim.

Praying for you Dan. 💕

As promised, my favorite interview ever with @tedcruz!

Wishing President Trump,  Melania Trump and Hope Hicks a quick recovery from COVID-19.

This is ridiculous!


Tomorrow morning we drop my favorite interview ever with @SenTedCruz.

Just dropped a brand new episode of @MegynKellyShow with @benshapiro -check it out here.

Or, just not in the tank for Biden and able to report fairly on both sides.
 
While I appreciate your website taking a break from watching The Bachelor & The Kardashians to try its hand at news analysis, consider trying it my way!
 
It’s really not hard.

Weird sweater!

Yates

It does look like I am naked!
 
Ha!
 
It’s just an off-the-shoulder sweater.

Curriculum night by zoom is not bad.


Best thing I have seen all day.

Try not to smile.

My second podcast - the first presidential debate!
 

Director Wray went on to clarify that the group is indeed a “movement,” a “real thing,” “not a fiction” that “engages in organized tactical activity at the local & regional level,” & it’s “dangerous.” 
To summarize this position w/“he said it’s an idea not an org” is dishonest.

I’m genuinely curious - toward whom do you think I am biased?

I’m there too!


Now!


Will be dropping our second podcast by Wed afternoon with complete post-debate analysis... and here’s a secret: 
we’ll have Ds AND Rs w/reaction.

Hope you will download & subscribe (it’s free) to The Megyn Kelly Show on Apple podcasts, etc.
Dems already saying there shouldn’t be any more debates.

Not a chance they cancel the others.

Can you imagine how weak Biden would look?

Surfed over to MSNBC - there is no Republican on the panel analyzing this debate.

And don’t say Nicole Wallace who is basically TV’s Jennifer Rubin.

Big winner of the night: Kanye?

Keep the moderator on cam &amp; give him/her the ability to cut the mics.

They will stop talking.
What a $&amp;@%show.

Biggest loser of this debate: us!


Wallace shutting down the Hunter line of attack isn’t going to please the Trump supporters.


Also - TENSE AND UNCOMFORTABLE exchange

Biden: “Antifa’s an idea, not an organization.”

Trump: “you gotta be kidding me.” 
Point: TRUMP

Biden’s retort was good - he puts gasoline on everything.

Biden: “there’s nothing we can’t do if we do it together!”

Protesters: raise the fist and say BLM or get the F away from your table. 🤔

Argh!! I wanted to hear Biden’s answer to that!!!

This is it: “why aren’t you saying the words law enforcement??”

Biden capable of landing blows when not interrupted
Annnddd... once again Biden ruins his good moment with a personal insult.

“He doesn’t want to let me answer bc he knows i have the truth” - best line from Biden so far

Trump took no real heat on taxes.

His biggest liability in this debate is what it is outside of this debate: looks like a bully.

Biden keeps erasing the advantage with name calling.

Strong answer again by Trump on his most vulnerable subject (COVID) arguing against the shutdowns.

My kids lol’ing about the “size of his mask” crack.

Biden takes what was a very strong answer on “do you trust him after all the lies” and ruins it by insulting Trump then seizes on.

Omg low road low road moment on “smart.”

This is Trump’s strongest answer.

On COVID.

Biden takes the bait: 
“will you shut up man?” That’s a fail for him.

Trump’s base will love his aggression; suburban moms and older voters?

Not so sure.
Biden calls Trump a clown before we hit the 18 min mark
Pocahontas!
 
Drink!

Biden can’t control Trump; keeps asking Wallace to help him.

Not a good look.

Handle it Mr. VP
Trump actually did prepare.
Biden on message: 
Obamacare, Obamacare, Obamacare...


#PresidentialDebate
Biden looks pale.

But then everyone does next to Trump.


#PresidentialDebate2020

@charlescwcooke on a serious tear here against that absurd apology letter from the OH St prof who - had the unmitigated nerve!
 - to call for the return of college football.
Laughed out loud reading CCWC.

Well done.

Thx @meghan_daum -more is on the way!
 
Post debate analysis tomorrow

Thank you for taking the time to listen!
 

Bc Wallace or his prep team would have to have leaked it.

I know them all, and they are above reproach.

There is zero chance that’s true.


Here’s what we have coming up the rest of this week on my new podcast-launch week of the @MegynKellyShow:


Loved this talk with @RubinReport.

First time I have ever responded “Bite me” to a Q (not directed at Dave of course).

“[A] community activist who works in [an area w/] many of the city’s Black residents...[says she] is in favor of more police officers.

‘The [City Council] didn’t engage Black & brown people’ [on defunding police, leaving] this community & me unsafe.’”

Happy Birthday D - may this year be the best one yet. 💕

Here’s what we have coming up this week.
Launch week of the @MegynKellyShow:
Today: @ggreenwaldPost-debate show with @krystalball and @esaagar, @hughhewitt
Thursday: @benshapiro
Friday: @tedcruz

I can't wait to hear what you think of the @MegynKellyShow.

You can find it on @ApplePodcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.



Today we dropped our first podcast, check it out for free here or wherever you get your podcasts.
And please let me know what you think!


My first podcast, very exciting!
 @GGreenwald sat down with me to discuss the election, the state of the media, &amp; the revolt v. Joe Rogan at Spotify.
He’s fascinating, check it out here: https://t.co/GBmznCtMpp

My 9-year-old daughter Yardley was the last person to use my shower before me.
Look what appeared on the glass door as it steamed up. 💕

This is such a great follow.
@DougBrunt is not an unbiased reviewer but check it out anyway!
 Go to Apple podcasts (or wherever you get your podcasts) & download The Megyn Kelly Show.
Also follow us on Twitter: @MegynKellyShow 

The Q is tax evasion (illegal) v tax avoidance (legal - most people try it) in the NYT Trump taxes story.
But Trump is not the only rich presidential candidate trying to dodge as many taxes as possible.


Thunder = happiness &amp; calm.


People can see the emptiness of these racist attacks on @DanielCameronAG and know he followed the law.
As he put it earlier this week, “in a world that is forcing many of us to pick a side, I choose the side of justice.
I choose the side of truth.” Same.


Guys, they’re going to attack her decision to adopt two children.
Her mothering.
And her/her children’s race.
Say a prayer for Amy Coney Barrett and her family tonight, and for the lost souls who think this is ok.
 

So we’re all ok with open, bigoted attacks on Catholics now?
Just trying to keep up.


Hey @NYGovCuomo - @JaniceDean is not giving up.
She and the other grieving families deserve answers.
Great job JD!
 

An honest, unbiased & spot-on (as usual) legal take from @AndrewCMcCarthy on the Breonna Taylor case.


Harry &amp; M, in an undisguised attempt to gain pity” opted “to portray the Prince..as a victim of oppression...The entire British state had conspired to ensure that Harry-for no reason other than..being a Prince-had never enjoyed the right of the common man” 

Open the schools 

Starting next week...


Two Louisville PD officers shot last night (non-life threatening injuries)... two cops seen on camera being shot in execution attempt in Compton, & look at this video from Seattle.
Disgusting, stomach-turning terrorism.


This was done beautifully, heart-breakingly and with class.
Praying for you Dan.


The Get Out the Vote effort for Trump continues!
 They’re doing an amazing job!
 (Ps - watch this video. 
 Just watch it.) 

This (and Bork) was the beginning of it all.
It’s the heart of the “you reap what you sow” argument against the Dems.
They broke the norms first.
