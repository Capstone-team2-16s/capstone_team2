Due to steep increases in Covid-19 cases, Army @FtBliss commander bans sit-down dining off base, trick or treating and institutes curfew. 
Bliss location in El Paso puts it in hotspot, no rounding of curve in sight right now.
To clarify...students will get free meals in DOD schools. 
It will be most helpful to military families that may be suffering financial hardships in pandemic.
Consider this part of the #pandemic hunger crisis: 
Military children now qualify for free meals in military families experiencing COVID related financial hardships.

For everyone‚Äôs awareness Gen Milley issued statement earlier via @thejointstaff

From Gen Milley (Joint Chiefs) spokesman, Colonel David Butler:
‚ÄúWe realize the COVID exposure of the Joint Chiefs could create doubt in the minds of the American people or our adversaries that America‚Äôs defenses are in some way compromised. 
They certainly are not‚Äù

"uniforms with the belt, everybody wanted the belt" touted by the President of the United States as a major military accomplishment.

Everyone should read this

UPDATE: Joint Chiefs, including Chairman Gen Mark Milley now expected to continue to work from home until Tuesday out of an abundance of caution following possible #COVID19 exposure: DOD official.

No masks? No social distancing?

so far we are told all have tested negative. day to day decision on when top brass comes back to Pentagon

Gen Milley offers an apology to Congressman Adam Schiff

Also worth pointing out many meetings at that time were via VTC at the highest levels of the Pentagon--in person contact was significantly reduced.


retweets B-1 bombing video (not clear if training or real) with male voice laughing over the bombing pictures.

You can listen to what he says by turning sound up.
Video then cuts to more serious military voices.

@Alyssafarah is also a former Pentagon spox

The point of the presidential suite is any president can be treated In a specific area without disrupting hospital ops.

So how did he meet troops?

On Oct 4 today spare a thought for the families whose loved ones fell on this day, decades apart, in Niger and Mogadishu.

This week DOD shut down an effort to rapidly get new gear to troops in combat.

May their memories be a blessing.

"There has been no change to our alert levels.

The US military stands ready to defend our country and its citizens.

especially when it comes to suicide in the military.

	
There is great concern among military commanders, especially in the Army that the isolation from #COVID19 may be leading to a rise in death by suicide in the ranks.

DOD will not call it a rise, commanders will.
Here are the facts.

A top senior Army enlisted leader posts this about the need for what he calls being "brutally honest"

Morning sky at Pentagon today.

Bonus: as I snapped the shot the little red fox that now lives near the metro entrance strolled by on his morning paw patrol.

yes it is. 
but do to certain events cute puppy tweets started early today.

Somehow this seemed timely for so many

A closeup look at Navy SEAL gear

Justice #RuthBaderGinsburg was laid to rest early this morning at @ArlingtonNatl next to her husband in a private ceremony. 
She had an Army escort at the cemetery.
Just as the troops honored her at the Capitol with precision and dignity.


It‚Äôs been 80 days since DoD leaders promised to release an investigation ‚Äòwithin days‚Äô into an Army helicopter buzzing protesters  

Right now, as a military team brings the casket of #JusticeRuthBaderGinsburg up the steps of the US Capitol, perhaps no greater reminder that US troops swear as oath to the Constitution and only to that North Star rule of law.


General Mark Milley, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff "We know factually that masks work."
Gen Mark Milley: ‚ÄùWe are right now in the midst of a general election and each of you have earned your right to vote.
So I would strongly encourage that everyone exercise their right vote when the time comes and use the rights that have been granted to you in the Constitution." 

Pentagon leadership remains adamant at staying out of partisan election politics and declaring the Constitution its North Star.
But the questions have not stopped.


"Let us not hedge about one thing," @bartongellman writes.
"Donald Trump may win or lose, but he will never concede." Who will stop him from throwing the election into chaos?


Most Americans would have no reason to know Gen Selva‚Äôs name.
But inside the very highest ranks he   is very respected.

Several DOD officials tell me Pentagon and Gen Milley continue to monitor the situation in Louisville as we learn of grand jury decision in the investigation into the killing of Breonna Taylor.
DOD goal: ensure civilian/state resources used & no need for active duty they say.
