retweets B-1 bombing video (not clear if training or real) with male voice laughing over the bombing pictures.

You can listen to what he says by turning sound up.
Video then cuts to more serious military voices.

@Alyssafarah is also a former Pentagon spox

The point of the presidential suite is any president can be treated In a specific area without disrupting hospital ops.

So how did he meet troops?

On Oct 4 today spare a thought for the families whose loved ones fell on this day, decades apart, in Niger and Mogadishu.

This week DOD shut down an effort to rapidly get new gear to troops in combat.

May their memories be a blessing.

especially when it comes to suicide in the military.

	
There is great concern among military commanders, especially in the Army that the isolation from #COVID19 may be leading to a rise in death by suicide in the ranks.

DOD will not call it a rise, commanders will.
Here are the facts.

A top senior Army enlisted leader posts this about the need for what he calls being "brutally honest"

Morning sky at Pentagon today.

Bonus: as I snapped the shot the little red fox that now lives near the metro entrance strolled by on his morning paw patrol.

yes it is. 
but do to certain events cute puppy tweets started early today.

Somehow this seemed timely for so many

Justice #RuthBaderGinsburg was laid to rest early this morning at @ArlingtonNatl next to her husband in a private ceremony. 
She had an Army escort at the cemetery.
Just as the troops honored her at the Capitol with precision and dignity.


It’s been 80 days since DoD leaders promised to release an investigation ‘within days’ into an Army helicopter buzzing protesters  

Right now, as a military team brings the casket of #JusticeRuthBaderGinsburg up the steps of the US Capitol, perhaps no greater reminder that US troops swear as oath to the Constitution and only to that North Star rule of law.


General Mark Milley, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff "We know factually that masks work."
Gen Mark Milley: ”We are right now in the midst of a general election and each of you have earned your right to vote.
So I would strongly encourage that everyone exercise their right vote when the time comes and use the rights that have been granted to you in the Constitution." 

Pentagon leadership remains adamant at staying out of partisan election politics and declaring the Constitution its North Star.
But the questions have not stopped.


"Let us not hedge about one thing," @bartongellman writes.
"Donald Trump may win or lose, but he will never concede." Who will stop him from throwing the election into chaos?


Most Americans would have no reason to know Gen Selva’s name.
But inside the very highest ranks he   is very respected.

Several DOD officials tell me Pentagon and Gen Milley continue to monitor the situation in Louisville as we learn of grand jury decision in the investigation into the killing of Breonna Taylor.
DOD goal: ensure civilian/state resources used & no need for active duty they say.
