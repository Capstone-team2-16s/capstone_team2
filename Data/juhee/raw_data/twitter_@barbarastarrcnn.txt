Will the commander in chief call their families? 
Will anyone in a civilian position of authority write a letter of condolence? 
Note new acting secretary of defense told troops in a late night memo he is their “leader”. 
not tweets or statements. 
Any actual reach out?
Wait. I thought it was about credible deterrence not about the Air Force being scary...more precisely “bomber trifecta scary”?
Hollyanne Milley, cardiac care nurse, is how its done. 
#FirstResponders actually do rock!
Btw the meeting was with the Lithuanian Defense Minister who graciously offered his condolences on the death of servicemembers in Sinai yesterday something we have yet to see from @realDonaldTrump I believe. 🇱🇹
The Pentagon press corps like press across the globe remains on the job. We are ...not...leaving...ever...
DOD press corps asked Acting SecDef Miller, Afghanistan troop withdrawal & adherence to Constitution at his first bilateral meeting. 
He didnt acknowledge questions and three members of press staff stepped in front of us blocking the way. 
That's their choice of course..but......
Tonight hours later no words of condolence from the commander in chief 
Gators on golf courses (in Florida of course!) are back!

#GenMilley Saddened by the loss our US service members. 
We stand in solidarity with our French and Czech partners as we all face the loss of our troops today in the Sinai Peninsula. 
Now in: Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller: 
“The Defense Department is deeply saddened by the loss of six U.S. and two partner nation service members in a helicopter crash in the Sinai Peninsula operating with the United Nations Multinational Force and Observers (MFO)."
And condolences to the French and Czech citizens who also lost their lives.
US military fatalities just increased by one in Sinai helo crash  today. 
Now 6 US servicemembers killed. 
Fact: not one word from  Pentagon, State or WH.  
Six Americans died today in service of the Constitution, the country and peace. 
May their memories be a blessing.
Turn up your speakers and listen to the sound of peace breaking out.

"I would prefer to leave like my predecessors in previous administrations left, everyone wants the dignified exit but if it's not to be it's not to be, I walk away holding my head high knowing I did the best I could, I put the country first,” Esper in Nov 4 interview w/CNN.
General Mark Milley,JCS chrm, held "tank" meeting with joint chiefs and combatant commanders around the world in the wake of Esper being fired, a senior US military official said.  
Mil officials will now call counterparts to assure them the US military maintains its stability.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows called Mark Esper just before President Trump tweeted that Esper had been “terminated”, according to a US defense official.

Due to steep increases in Covid-19 cases, Army @FtBliss commander bans sit-down dining off base, trick or treating and institutes curfew.

To clarify...students will get free meals in DOD schools. 
It will be most helpful to military families that may be suffering financial hardships in pandemic.
Consider this part of the #pandemic hunger crisis: 
Military children now qualify for free meals in military families experiencing COVID related financial hardships.

For everyone’s awareness Gen Milley issued statement earlier via @thejointstaff
From Gen Milley (Joint Chiefs) spokesman, Colonel David Butler:
“We realize the COVID exposure of the Joint Chiefs could create doubt in the minds of the American people or our adversaries that America’s defenses are in some way compromised. 
They certainly are not”
"uniforms with the belt, everybody wanted the belt" touted by the President of the United States as a major military accomplishment.
Everyone should read this
UPDATE: Joint Chiefs, including Chairman Gen Mark Milley now expected to continue to work from home until Tuesday out of an abundance of caution following possible #COVID19 exposure: DOD official.
No masks? No social distancing?
so far we are told all have tested negative. day to day decision on when top brass comes back to Pentagon
Gen Milley offers an apology to Congressman Adam Schiff
Also worth pointing out many meetings at that time were via VTC at the highest levels of the Pentagon--in person contact was significantly reduced.

You can listen to what he says by turning sound up.
Video then cuts to more serious military voices.

The point of the presidential suite is any president can be treated In a specific area without disrupting hospital ops.
So how did he meet troops?
On Oct 4 today spare a thought for the families whose loved ones fell on this day, decades apart, in Niger and Mogadishu.
This week DOD shut down an effort to rapidly get new gear to troops in combat.
May their memories be a blessing.

especially when it comes to suicide in the military.
There is great concern among military commanders, especially in the Army that the isolation from #COVID19 may be leading to a rise in death by suicide in the ranks.
DOD will not call it a rise, commanders will.
Here are the facts.
A top senior Army enlisted leader posts this about the need for what he calls being "brutally honest"

Morning sky at Pentagon today.
Bonus: as I snapped the shot the little red fox that now lives near the metro entrance strolled by on his morning paw patrol.
yes it is. 
but do to certain events cute puppy tweets started early today.
Somehow this seemed timely for so many

Justice #RuthBaderGinsburg was laid to rest early this morning at @ArlingtonNatl next to her husband in a private ceremony. 
She had an Army escort at the cemetery.
Just as the troops honored her at the Capitol with precision and dignity.
It’s been 80 days since DoD leaders promised to release an investigation ‘within days’ into an Army helicopter buzzing protesters  
Right now, as a military team brings the casket of #JusticeRuthBaderGinsburg up the steps of the US Capitol, perhaps no greater reminder that US troops swear as oath to the Constitution and only to that North Star rule of law.
General Mark Milley, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff "We know factually that masks work."
Gen Mark Milley: ”We are right now in the midst of a general election and each of you have earned your right to vote.
So I would strongly encourage that everyone exercise their right vote when the time comes and use the rights that have been granted to you in the Constitution." 
Pentagon leadership remains adamant at staying out of partisan election politics and declaring the Constitution its North Star.
But the questions have not stopped.
"Let us not hedge about one thing," @bartongellman writes.
"Donald Trump may win or lose, but he will never concede." Who will stop him from throwing the election into chaos?
Most Americans would have no reason to know Gen Selva’s name.
But inside the very highest ranks he   is very respected.
Several DOD officials tell me Pentagon and Gen Milley continue to monitor the situation in Louisville as we learn of grand jury decision in the investigation into the killing of Breonna Taylor.
DOD goal: ensure civilian/state resources used & no need for active duty they say.
