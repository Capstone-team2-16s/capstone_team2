I've also been told that absentee ballots are never counted unless they need to be. 
For all of the absentee ballots coming in now ... are they counting them now? 
Or only on election day and if they have to? 
#Election2020AG
question: if you apply for an absentee ballot and receive it ... can you still vote in person? 
how do they know?  
how does it work?

We couldn't do this story without naming the winner of the debate &amp; that's Kristen Welker for her sharp moderating, keeping the discussion moving and the candidates on topic. 
I think the last debate moderator Chris Wallace is jealous. 
In fact, he said exactly that.)
Thank you!
This just came sauntering out of nowhere and crawled across my windshield and then slithered back into the upholstery siding.

Why is all discussion about that? 
Like we as women don‚Äôt have anything else to offer.

Trump: ‚ÄúDid you ever hear the expression under-levered?‚Äù 
What a condescending question to @SavannahGuthrie
Switching to Biden #townhall ‚Äî it‚Äôs more sane and even keeled ... but whose watching?
Trump said he didn‚Äôt eat after a person brought him his meal and touched his mask ‚Äî 
yet he never wore a mask.

Next Presidential debate will be VIRTUAL. 
I've always said much more tough for nterruptus to take place when Biden & Trump won't be on the same LIVE stage together.

I'm so sorry for the secret service and I pray none get sick or worse.

Obviously Dr. Conley felt he had to tell the American public more info than yesterday ....
so there were some details.

But then, the same pattern ... more questions with no answers.

Question of the day: WHEN WAS THE LAST NEGATIVE TEST THE PRESIDENT OF THE United States RECEIVED?


#covid19 

#TrumpCovid
funny if it weren't so serious
Just to be clear ...
Fox News not covering this point.


And ... using an experimental therapy on President Trump potentially to thwart the symptoms -- 
maybe so he wouldn't have to tell the American public he had #Covid19 or at the very least when he knew he had it?


#TrumpCovid

Wow. 



#TrumpCovid

So what's the real timeline of when the President knew he was #Covid19 positive?

His doctor said 72 hours ago.

If that's true he went to NJ and MN knowing he had symptoms?


#TrumpCovid

totally
And didn't get the test at the debate on Tuesday ...

How will this affect all of the ABC people Christie was sitting next to on debate night LIVE on air?


Remember.

Chris Wallace has said President Trump arrived too late to the debate to take a #Covid19 test (as was required).

That was Tuesday night.

Thursday night he was positive.

There's more reporting to be done here.


#TrumpCovid

good point.

meant about my experience

Brit Hume has a history of being a blowhard about things he knows nothing about.

He was one of the first to malign me publicly just like this after I filed my harassment case against Roger Ailes at Fox.

Whose surprised

Exactly ... wish I could comment more about that source

I wish I could comment
Wow

wow

Let me get this straight.

Pres Trumps family refused to wear masks at debate even when asked by Cleveland Clinic reps.

Pres still goes to NJ fundraiser after knowing Hope Hicks tested positive.

At Supreme Court presser attendees shook hands, hugged & were maskless.

How selfish.

How stupid ‚Äî all of those people at the White House event for Supreme Court pick shaking hands and not wearing masks ‚Äî now it‚Äôs turned into a #COVID19 super spreader event.

Chris Wallace is appealing to Trump to stop interrupting.

This is like a toddler having a tantrum.
Too bad nobody can get a timeout.

Finally ‚Äî Chris Wallace demands an answer about trumps taxes.


#PresidentialDebate

Wallace to Trump: ‚Äúyou‚Äôve agreed to the 2 minutes‚Äù.

This is why they should cut the mic when they don‚Äôt honor the 2 minutes 

#PresidentialDebate2020

Was thinking exact thing

Trump accuses Biden of not being able to get the crowds ‚Äî and if he could ... that Biden would hold the same gatherings he‚Äôs been holding advocating no masks.


#debate

Great idea

Thank you!


Interesting how Joe Biden has been coached to not look at Pres Trump ‚Äî speaking straight forward.

Maybe because Trumps strategy is to malign and degrade.

Quote: ‚ÄúNothing smart about you Joe.‚Äù 

#debate

Trump says he disagrees with his own person on when the vaccine for #covid will be ready.

#Debates2020

Too bad the rule for this debate wasn‚Äôt that the candidates had to wear masks to shut up when the other one is talking.

VP Joe Biden takes off the gloves ‚Äî says everything Trump says is a liar.


#Debate2020 

#Debate

Wow ‚Äî Trump trying to steamroll Chris Wallace ‚Äî saying he‚Äôs debating Wallace and saying he‚Äôs not surprised.

Chris Wallace obviously nervous for this debate ... will he be able to control this debate?
