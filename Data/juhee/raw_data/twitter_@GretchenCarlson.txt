Former President George W. Bush congratulated President-elect Joe Biden in a phone call Sunday and said that, while President Donald Trump has the right to pursue legal challenges and recounts, the 2020 race was "fundamentally fair" and "its outcome is clear."
Thank you for this message of hope @JoeBiden. 
Unity is my goal too - doesn’t mean I’m being unrealistic or that i don’t understand both sides b/c I do. 
The last 4 yrs - so many fractured families & friendships, so if we don’t have hope - what do we have? 
More hate?
So sad. 
Thank you for such a great show!
On Eagle's wings ... yes ... He will lift us up. 
Yes he will.
agree
@JoeBiden  I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me and for those who did." 
YES! Cooperate. 
Please bring the parties back together. 
"The American people want us to cooperate for their interests."
@JoeBiden "this is a time to heal in america". 
yes! im for that. 
I've been preaching that for the last 4 years. 
we must come together.
@JoeBiden asks Trump supporters to give each other a chance -- time to put away the harsh rhetoric and see and listen to each other again. 
AGREE.
"While I may be the first woman in power I don't be the last". 
Please NEVER forget that. 
We've got this #forallwomen -- we've broken the glass ceiling now. 
The world is in front of us. 
Little girls KNOW NOW because they see it!
Yes women who have fought for equality and liberty and justice for all - thank you. 
You helped hold up a woman standing tonight on the stage as VP elect. 
Thank you @JoeBiden for selecting a woman as yourVP b/c this is a country of possibilities.

Would that be my vote that I dropped off at a drop of box on Monday that probably wasn’t counted until Election Day or later? 
Trust me - it was legal. 
#PresidentialElection
Will be interesting to see how Fox News reports this. 
Wow
But it works both ways. 
The counting in AZ for example is helping President Trump right?
Should we count the votes in all outstanding states or just the ones that favor certain candidates? 
Come on.
We're smarter than that. 
#PresidentialElection2020

scary. 
we live in a democracy. 
these are votes that people cast by choosing to mail in or drop them off instead of going to the polls. 
that's legal.
Listening to @smerconish now on @cnn. Smart. 
"Fraud is a stinging word and you can't just throw that label around or theft without backing it up. 
Trump is entitled to a fair count but you can't make baseless accusations. 
Show me something." Ditto.

Question of the day: WHEN WAS THE LAST NEGATIVE TEST THE PRESIDENT OF THE United States RECEIVED?


#covid19 

#TrumpCovid
funny if it weren't so serious
Just to be clear ...
Fox News not covering this point.


And ... using an experimental therapy on President Trump potentially to thwart the symptoms -- 
maybe so he wouldn't have to tell the American public he had #Covid19 or at the very least when he knew he had it?


#TrumpCovid

Wow. 



#TrumpCovid

So what's the real timeline of when the President knew he was #Covid19 positive?

His doctor said 72 hours ago.

If that's true he went to NJ and MN knowing he had symptoms?


#TrumpCovid

totally
And didn't get the test at the debate on Tuesday ...

How will this affect all of the ABC people Christie was sitting next to on debate night LIVE on air?


Remember.

Chris Wallace has said President Trump arrived too late to the debate to take a #Covid19 test (as was required).

That was Tuesday night.

Thursday night he was positive.

There's more reporting to be done here.


#TrumpCovid

good point.

meant about my experience

Brit Hume has a history of being a blowhard about things he knows nothing about.

He was one of the first to malign me publicly just like this after I filed my harassment case against Roger Ailes at Fox.

Whose surprised

Exactly ... wish I could comment more about that source

I wish I could comment
Wow

wow

Let me get this straight.

Pres Trumps family refused to wear masks at debate even when asked by Cleveland Clinic reps.

Pres still goes to NJ fundraiser after knowing Hope Hicks tested positive.

At Supreme Court presser attendees shook hands, hugged & were maskless.

How selfish.

How stupid — all of those people at the White House event for Supreme Court pick shaking hands and not wearing masks — now it’s turned into a #COVID19 super spreader event.

Let’s stop arbitration and NDAs too!
 

COVID-19 has led 1 in 4 women to contemplate downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce entirely, 1 in 3 moms may be forced to scale back or opt out.

Companies must rise or risk unwinding years of progress for gender equality.


#WomenInTheWorkplace

yes!


I thought this was supposed to end at 1030pmET.

Pls take us all out of our misery.


#PresidentialDebate2020

Depressing

The sad thing is ... take politics out of it ... this is not how we raise our kids.

Do we teach them to have ....
No respect, to bully, to not follow the rules (that his campaign agreed to by the way).


#PresidentialDebate2020

This is embarrassing ...


#PresidentialDebate2020
Agree

Jealous
Haha
Haha

Chris Wallace is appealing to Trump to stop interrupting.

This is like a toddler having a tantrum.
Too bad nobody can get a timeout.


#PresidentialDebate

They need you Doris!


Biden: It’s hard to get any word in with this clown.
 

#PresidentialDebate

This is a s*** show.

Nobody can control him I don’t think.

Cut his mic!!!

I have a colonoscopy tomorrow!
 
No wine ... no nothing!
 

Biden: “You’re the worst President America has ever had” 

#PresidentialDebate
Finally — Chris Wallace demands an answer about trumps taxes.


#PresidentialDebate

Wallace to Trump: “you’ve agreed to the 2 minutes”.

This is why they should cut the mic when they don’t honor the 2 minutes 

#PresidentialDebate2020

Was thinking exact thing

Trump accuses Biden of not being able to get the crowds — and if he could ... that Biden would hold the same gatherings he’s been holding advocating no masks.


#debate

Great idea

Thank you!


Interesting how Joe Biden has been coached to not look at Pres Trump — speaking straight forward.

Maybe because Trumps strategy is to malign and degrade.

Quote: “Nothing smart about you Joe.” 

#debate

Trump says he disagrees with his own person on when the vaccine for #covid will be ready.


#debate

Trump: “You could have never done the job Joe — it’s not in your blood.” 

#Debates2020 

#debate

Biden finally says it: shut up.


#DebateTuesday 

#debate

Too bad the rule for this debate wasn’t that the candidates had to wear masks to shut up when the other one is talking.


#DebateTuesday 

#debate

VP Joe Biden takes off the gloves — says everything Trump says is a liar.


#Debate2020 

#Debate

Wow — Trump trying to steamroll Chris Wallace — saying he’s debating Wallace and saying he’s not surprised.


#debate

Chris Wallace obviously nervous for this debate ... will he be able to control this debate?


#Debates2020 

#debatetuesday

So the gloves are off now — the discussion portion will be where the fireworks are between Trump and Biden 
- 
#DebateTuesday

President Trump quoting the Notorious RBG!

WTF

Sad 

Sometimes when we are generous in small, barely detectable ways it can change someone else’s life forever.
