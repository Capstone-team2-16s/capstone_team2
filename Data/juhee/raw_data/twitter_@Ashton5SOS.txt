This right here is a CD i burnt of Superbloom as soon as I finished it.
I took one to Calum, gave one to my friend’s Matt and Dan and then Posted one to my Mum in Australia.

I got way too excited on the guitar 🤣 fully ripping a solo on an acoustic 🤣

You hear in this voice memo my voice and matt pauling on guitar, discovering the song that would inspire a whole record.

Have u found what ur looking for?

comes out everywhere this Friday and I can’t wait for you to hear it. - A i 

Sharing the first ever voice memo of a song that’s freshly written is, to be honest, absolutely terrifying. ut in my opinion, the purest form of a song, before we turn it into a full production.

This is the genesis of my record SUPERBLOOM.
This song is about overcoming mental resistance, and facing every fear you’ve ever had.
This is “Have u found what ur looking for?”.

Out Friday at midnight local time - A i 



Listening to the test press of vinyl of #superbloom.
My heart is racing and I have one million feelings about what this album really means to me.
I’m so ready to show you some of the most personal and real songs I’ve ever written.


Hey skinny skinny.
Don’t you think about the future.
Hey skinny skinny too bad.
Hey skinny skinny.
Stop your thinking bout tomorrow.
You’ll never make it like that.
(Too bad)

The Skinny Skinny MV faces + fights back against the demon that lives in the mirror.
I wanted to capture the struggle of not feeling at home in your own body.
A video of battle, footage of the fight, a snapshot of resilience.
I hope you find it empowering.
