Happy National Drummer Day! ❤️
Omg crazy!!!! Massive milestone for my second ever banger!
Thank you for listening everyone, this is pretty jaw dropping for me. 
I’m really proud of this record and to see how you’re connecting with it makes me feel like I’m doing something really real and true ❤️
😀
I shot this cover at home with my partner @kaykay. 
We wanted something that looked like “pop / grunge” with the feeling of a sinister empty room to represent the feeling of codependency.
Heart-Shaped Box is lined with one of the most beautiful melodies wrapped in barbed wire. 
Kurt Cobain’s mastery is being respected in my cover in many ways. 
One of them being I by no means tried to sing it like him, I gave it my own take. Enjoy.
It’s beautifully shot and the grading is exceptional. 
Lenny is a master stage Performer and a fluid creative soul! 
Check it 🥰🙏
If you know me you know I am a massive fan of @LennyKravitz. 
I wanted to share this with you if you’re stuck at home today. 
This is one of my favorite “rock doc’s” ever.
Thank you for getting my album! 
I love seeing this type of thing on my timeline! 
2756 ❤️
I signed around 600!
@EMIMusicAU need some more signed copies of superbloom?
Still waiting for ALL my merch. 
A i is slow AF
I’m still waiting for mine 😂
These blew my mind, sent to my manager matt cause THIS is exactly how it’s supposed to feel. 
Nice job, you’re awesome
Hello world
Sitting on my bed, recorded a “late night feels” version of Greyhound in my voice memos 
Stream for an incredible cause! 
Nice work Niall! 🔥❤️
Aw man. 
Thank you 🙏 ❤️
Me! 😂
the energy today
I made this for exactly the purpose you’ve articulated! Please re watch all the time ❤️❤️❤️
Wow, this makes my heart so happy!
Deserves a big follow!!!
My favorite shirt 🥰 
I’m still waiting for mine
Looks wonderful! 
Thanks for purchasing ❤️
Honestly, with the way touring’s going, I’d do it for a panini and a Diet Coke
It’s just a mess rn, haven’t done anything to it since I shot skinny. 
Sorry 😂 
I’m looking kinda chaotic
Well, this day was nerve racking because we didn’t have any experience (or business) doing photo shoots. 
This was our first one ever and it was super awkward 🤣
Maybe... but a song like this goes a lot further when it’s handled with care. 
Lots of people love it and it hasn’t been promoted to death. 
Also at the time I don’t think radio woulda dug it that much
Aw you sound lovely. 
You have a wholesome tone and a fantastic natural vibrato! 
You rule! 
Thanks for sharing with us!
These are amazing. 
Saving them all!
Today mark’s an amazing success for @5sos album youngblood and the song “Ghost Of You”. 
This song wasn’t a single but has managed to rack up an incredible 100 million streams. 
Mind blown. 
Thank you everyone! ❤️
“No I can’t, live a lie, you can’t make me.” 
“I’m to blame” was inspired by the seductive darkness of The Rolling Stones “paint it black”. 
I wrote the song with Matt P about a psychedelic trip.
When the world leaves a scar on you 
#superbloom
I’m tempted to get this!
Follow your gut, follow your intuition.
If we spend our lives dependent on other people, how do we become ourselves? 
If you feel trapped in a situation, you feel trapped in a relationship, you feel trapped in your own life....this song is for you to feel in your bones what’s right.
This era of personal fashion was so relaxed and cool. 
I remember everyone used to dress like this to come to our shows. 
I’m now reminded of mikes “IDIOT” brand on the flannel T’s. Iconic
Thank you for watching #superbloomfilm2020 💚
Lights out, the show has begun

SUPERBLOOM: A LIVE CONCERT FILM. 
Tomorrow at 6pm ET.
It’s all you!!!
Omg, this is absolutely spectacular. 
You have an incredible gift
I view it this way. 
All of you have given me/us the most wonderful rare opportunity to make music for a living. 
So imma go as hard as I can for as long as I can to raise my personal bar to the next level! 
It’s my responsibility to deliver with passion!
Kinda dude
I really got into my influences in this interview, diving into where my inspiration came from during writing Superbloom, maybe some artists you didn’t expect
Yeah, I wanna learn how to not work all the time
The best influence is be un-influenced. 
Be careful what your mind consumes. 
And make sure you’re not stressed. 
Stress will ruin the process
This is a tricky question. 
My main role in 5SOS isn’t really vocals. 
I work a lot on the visuals, the lyrics, the way the songs sound, and how to build a team behind the scenes to do things the best they can be
Maybe when the band settled down! 
I would’ve been on tour all year this year. 
So probably no such thing as Superbloom without the pandemic
It’s a guitar Viola and it’s one of matts strong points as a composer. 
He’s the mastermind behind the orchestration
Nope! This is all of them. 
There was a song called “Glass” that matt composed but I never wrote melody or lyrics to it
Superbloom has many definitions to me. 
Mainly, I’ve begun living my true path, and not hiding from myself! 
I’m blossoming into the man I am in a truthful way
Felt really natural this process cause there isn’t any other writers to enforce their wants and needs from the music. 
I made an album in a cohesive way, without outside influence. 
So it happened really naturally
I don’t think so! 
Who knows...
My end goal is to continue on a creative song writing path for as long as people listen!
Head voice *
I do pretty intense vocal lessons, but have been training vocally since I was 17! 
This record was an awesome learning experience thought cause I got into a bunch of different vocal techniques I hadn’t focused on before! 
Linking chest to hear voice and doubling a lot of tracks!
I know right. 
I’m sorry everyone! 
One day maybe if my music does well! 💕🙏❤️
No more music videos for this record. 
Since I’m independently doing this, I don’t have enough budget for another video right now!
No idea, when Im with the band in the studio again, we’ll explore all kinds of genres I’m sure. 
Gotta come back with some HEAT
I really went for a grunge sound that I love. 
I’m so stoked you vibe with it. This song is an epic one for sure!
It’s funny but, I saw this a couple days ago. 
And pondered for a while on its shape and color. 
Superbloom really is a vortex like this. 
Every album in its own way is. 
It transports you, mind, and spirit to a totally different frame of mind
I really liked Vivarium. 
It’s a cool twist on multidimensional beings that can hide amongst our 3D reality!
A beautiful song about the frustrations of media consumption and how depressed, confused and inhuman it can make you feel.
You will overcome all of this. thank you for being human and real with us! 
We can create a positive community of support and growth if we all show each other love and respect.
Well I appreciate the encouragement. 
This made me feel really happy. 
Thank you for really listening in to the details!
Thank you, I let go of a lot of pre conceived notions I had about lyrics and songwriting on this record. 
I just made something that’s “me” and honest. 
Superbloom is everything (almost) I love about alternative pop rock!
We could tie another knot between us and some hope.
The merch is made to elevate your vibration and everyone around you! 
Looks beautiful! 
Thank you for getting a shirt 💚
Go out and Vote
My Intuitive nature led me to where I am today! 
Thank you @NotionMagazine 
I loved this conversation! 💚🙌🏻
Omg 😂😂😂 
this is so good 😂
I didn’t wanna show this to you guys cause I was ashamed for a moment, but now I can’t get this song I wrote for call of duty out of my head
I kNOW OMG! It’s so awesome!!!!! 
ALTERNATIVE ASHTON WILL RISE
Painful lessons are a perfect tool, schools in session and the number one rule *YOU SING IT* ...
Lmaoooo this is crazy. 
I love it
Tikky Tokky
Hello my name is Ashton and I’m finally on Tik Tok ( 😂 ) 
Thank you honey bee 💚💚💚
Just reminded me of how we speak to each other in 5SOS lol 😂
Thank you for allowing me to try and be a light and help. 
Absolutely incredible considering I didn’t have any music released over a month ago. 
This is amazing GROWTH.
Staying in my room all day and listening to Superbloom
The Greyhound Guitar solo
“Greyhounds dart around a racetrack lightning fast. They eat lean and are trained to win and NEVER loose.” 
Over the past month, since the release of Skinny Skinny, and now releasing SUPERBLOOM, I’ve felt so much respect, kindness and love from my family, everyone on here, and my friends. 
Thank you for everything! 
I hope you love my album for a long time to come.
Blood of the rabbit,
It stains my teeth. 
I got my whole ass nipples exposed for all of Toronto to see
THIS. Yes, you’re sharing the album and amplifying it’s voice in a way that is incredible 💚
“SUPERBLOOM is a bright Lotus in a mud pile of a year” 
#SUPERBLOOM is officially here. 
I hope you find positivity and a welcoming feeling to my little world of music. 
I have enjoyed every single step of making this record and am a better person today because of it, and look forward to what is to come!
“The over-arching narrative is support system, healing, recovery, strength and focus on true self. 
I felt like I had a lot to write about,”
“Developing a kinder voice to myself, developing the need to dig into my narrative as a lyricist, and share that with people. 
Because if it’s happened to me, it’s happened to a lot of people.”
Cannot wait for you all to hear #SUPERBLOOM tonight. 
Join me in listening live on my Instagram at 9pm PST 💚
TONIGHT 💚 
#SUPERBLOOM

The pure energy this emits is amazing. Nice work
Thanks Jess, really excited to share some new material with you 💚💚💚
You can still order CD’s! 
They’ll come from AUS though
Yes! I fumble around mainly Pro Create. 
@kaykay is the photoshop wizard. She’s incredible at it. 
It’s definitely an ambition of mind to work on that next year, it’d really help with my Merch designs.
Only 3 more days until #SUPERBLOOM 💚
Massive win’s all round!
Sunshine ☀️
Considering I’m working independently apart from in AUS. 
I didn’t want to make CD’s for every market because the format isn’t popular anymore. 
So most music markets will be streaming (DSP’s) and Vinyl (the way I intended people to listen)
This sketch turned into these images!
Here’s some sketches of font’s and images I wanted to take that I was thinking up before actually going and going and actualizing things. 
Thought I’d share! X
S U P E R B L O O M

Man... this is so cool, very stoked.
It’s just something I do when I write music, I always write on the windows, etc. focusing all my energy on the music
Listening to the Vinyl 💚

Superbloom will be yours in less than a week. 
Make it rain green hearts!!! 💚

The feedback on my song SCAR is so incredible. 
I must’ve listened to that song thousands of times before it was released and it never got old, I hope you feel the same.
Thank you for streaming Skinny a million times. 
I’m so connected to this song and it’s message. 
By streaming this track you show me that it was the right move to release it first. 
Love!

This right here is a CD i burnt of Superbloom as soon as I finished it.
I took one to Calum, gave one to my friend’s Matt and Dan and then Posted one to my Mum in Australia.
I got way too excited on the guitar 🤣 fully ripping a solo on an acoustic 🤣
You hear in this voice memo my voice and matt pauling on guitar, discovering the song that would inspire a whole record.
Have u found what ur looking for?
comes out everywhere this Friday and I can’t wait for you to hear it. - A i 
Sharing the first ever voice memo of a song that’s freshly written is, to be honest, absolutely terrifying. ut in my opinion, the purest form of a song, before we turn it into a full production.
This is the genesis of my record SUPERBLOOM.
This song is about overcoming mental resistance, and facing every fear you’ve ever had.
This is “Have u found what ur looking for?”.
Out Friday at midnight local time - A i 
Listening to the test press of vinyl of #superbloom.
My heart is racing and I have one million feelings about what this album really means to me.
I’m so ready to show you some of the most personal and real songs I’ve ever written.
Hey skinny skinny.
Don’t you think about the future.
Hey skinny skinny too bad.
Hey skinny skinny.
Stop your thinking bout tomorrow.
You’ll never make it like that.
(Too bad)
