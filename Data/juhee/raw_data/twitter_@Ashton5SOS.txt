Hello my name is Ashton and I’m finally on Tik Tok ( 😂 ) 

Thank you honey bee 💚💚💚
Just reminded me of how we speak to each other in 5SOS lol 😂
Thank you for allowing me to try and be a light and help. 
Absolutely incredible considering I didn’t have any music released over a month ago. 
This is amazing GROWTH.
Staying in my room all day and listening to Superbloom
The Greyhound Guitar solo
“Greyhounds dart around a racetrack lightning fast. They eat lean and are trained to win and NEVER loose.” 
Over the past month, since the release of Skinny Skinny, and now releasing SUPERBLOOM, I’ve felt so much respect, kindness and love from my family, everyone on here, and my friends. 
Thank you for everything! 
I hope you love my album for a long time to come.
Blood of the rabbit,
It stains my teeth. 
I got my whole ass nipples exposed for all of Toronto to see
THIS. Yes, you’re sharing the album and amplifying it’s voice in a way that is incredible 💚
“SUPERBLOOM is a bright Lotus in a mud pile of a year” 
#SUPERBLOOM is officially here. 
I hope you find positivity and a welcoming feeling to my little world of music. 
I have enjoyed every single step of making this record and am a better person today because of it, and look forward to what is to come!
“The over-arching narrative is support system, healing, recovery, strength and focus on true self. 
I felt like I had a lot to write about,”
“Developing a kinder voice to myself, developing the need to dig into my narrative as a lyricist, and share that with people. 
Because if it’s happened to me, it’s happened to a lot of people.”

Cannot wait for you all to hear #SUPERBLOOM tonight. 
Join me in listening live on my Instagram at 9pm PST 💚
TONIGHT 💚

The pure energy this emits is amazing. Nice work
Thanks Jess, really excited to share some new material with you 💚💚💚
You can still order CD’s! 
They’ll come from AUS though
Yes! I fumble around mainly Pro Create. 
@kaykay is the photoshop wizard. She’s incredible at it. 
It’s definitely an ambition of mind to work on that next year, it’d really help with my Merch designs.
Only 3 more days until #SUPERBLOOM 💚
Massive win’s all round!
Sunshine ☀️
Considering I’m working independently apart from in AUS. 
I didn’t want to make CD’s for every market because the format isn’t popular anymore. 
So most music markets will be streaming (DSP’s) and Vinyl (the way I intended people to listen)
This sketch turned into these images!
Here’s some sketches of font’s and images I wanted to take that I was thinking up before actually going and going and actualizing things. 
Thought I’d share! X

This right here is a CD i burnt of Superbloom as soon as I finished it.
I took one to Calum, gave one to my friend’s Matt and Dan and then Posted one to my Mum in Australia.

I got way too excited on the guitar 🤣 fully ripping a solo on an acoustic 🤣

You hear in this voice memo my voice and matt pauling on guitar, discovering the song that would inspire a whole record.

Have u found what ur looking for?

comes out everywhere this Friday and I can’t wait for you to hear it. - A i 

Sharing the first ever voice memo of a song that’s freshly written is, to be honest, absolutely terrifying. ut in my opinion, the purest form of a song, before we turn it into a full production.

This is the genesis of my record SUPERBLOOM.
This song is about overcoming mental resistance, and facing every fear you’ve ever had.
This is “Have u found what ur looking for?”.

Out Friday at midnight local time - A i 



Listening to the test press of vinyl of #superbloom.
My heart is racing and I have one million feelings about what this album really means to me.
I’m so ready to show you some of the most personal and real songs I’ve ever written.


Hey skinny skinny.
Don’t you think about the future.
Hey skinny skinny too bad.
Hey skinny skinny.
Stop your thinking bout tomorrow.
You’ll never make it like that.
(Too bad)
