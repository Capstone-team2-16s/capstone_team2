Trump calls Kamala Harris "a communist" she's not a socialist.

Trump campaign manager says in a statement that instead of the second Presidential debate they will do a "rally instead"

After shutting down the coronavirus economic stimulus negotiations with congressional democrats, Trump says there are now "very productive talks" going on re a new stimulus package, that they are "talking about" aid for airlines, direct aid checks to taxpayers...and other things.
Trump:
" I don't think I'm contagious"

On how he caught it : 
It was a day of celebration with Notre Dame ( apparently referring to the SCOTUS nominee announcement event in the Rose Garden)

"I think I would have done fine without drugs."

Trump says I'm not doing a virtual debate' in an interview with FBN

The debate commission said the candidates in the second debate would participate from separate remote locations in an effort to protect the health and safety of all involved

Ummm... 


So far I think. 
Miss you!
Let the fact checks begin: Kamala Harris and Mike Pence debate



How are u?

VP pivots to Court packing speech and doesn’t answer question when asked  how Trump will protect coverage for people with preexisting conditions while in court trying to end the Affordable Care Act.
Then Pence says Harris refused to answer his court packing question. 
#jujitsu

Harris Jamarican comes out speaking directly to camera with her health care attack on Trump and Pence: 
“they’re coming for you “ - reminiscent of the Bob Marley/ Bad Boy lyrics:

Instead of we flattened the curve, we took a whole of government approach- now it’s we trust the American people. 
Sen. Harris : 
trust the American people by telling them the truth.



Did u draw that Ames?
Ohhhh forgot about the cocktail. Thank u for that .. 

The President’s physician says he has been symptom free for 24 hours, fever free for four days, and that he is showing detectable levels of Covid antibodies. He says Trump told him he feels “great!”

I heard one of the raccoons (pretty sure there are more than one)  slipped into a WH guard shack last night .. they're totally  unafraid of people at this stage.

EBOF raises a serious question:

Now Christie is positive

“Just 72 hours into the diagnosis now”... wait what?

This requires clarification because 72 hours ago was Wednesday.

“The jarring contrast between the carefree, cavalier attitude toward the virus on display in the Rose Garden Saturday and the pernicious awakening that occurred Thursday night resembles a Shakespearean tragedy.”

@presssec says White House operations deemed it safe for Trump to travel to New Jersey fundraiser after Hope Hicks was diagnosed.
But the first calculation here should have been about protecting donors in NJ from contagion caused by the President and his traveling party.

Attendee at the SCOTUS announcement tests positive.

It raises the question: 
whether the spread that reached the President started at the Barrett announcement?

Senator Lee tests positive 

RE:chronology at White House yesterday.

I asked COS Mark Meadows &amp; he said he wasn’t doing a “tic toc” but that they discovered Hope Hicks had tested positive as Marine 1 was taking off.

Couldn’t agree more

The question about the President's Proud Boys position posed to Sen. Scott.

Scott didn't just say "I think he misspoke." 
He also said that if the President doesn't correct it, 'I guess he didn't misspeak.'  
What does that mean?

Um, yes, precisely.

On the economy Trump’s strong point according to the polls:

On Health Care Biden on Trump: 
“He has no plan and the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”

Trump talks over Biden and the moderator making himself the center of attention as usual.
