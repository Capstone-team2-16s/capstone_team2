It’s with a heavy heart I will be postponing my upcoming European tour to September and October 2021. 
We have continued to monitor this unprecedented and changing situation, and it has become clear that it is not possible to go ahead with the tour in January and February.
Thrilled to hear I’m nominated in 4 categories at the #Los40MusicAwards 2020 for Best Artist, Best Album, Best Song and Best Video! 
Thank you so much @Los40, I love you Spain 🇪🇸

It’s been so interesting and fun to learn about designing with such an iconic London brand who started from scratch on a stall in Portobello market in the 1970’s.
