A longtime Trump adviser on Trump’s tweets instructing GSA to begin transition: 
“there you go. It’s over.” 
The GSA press office is describing the letter from @GSAEmily as a “letter of ascertainment...” 
This is the most open Trump has sounded about a transition since the election. 
Of course Trump being Trump he could totally reverse course.  
And there almost two months to go before Jan 20.
Our @KristenhCNN reporting that GSA has informed Biden team in letter to begin transition and has notified WH COS Meadows in that same letter that GSA is starting the process.
CNN: The Michigan Board of State Canvassers certified election results for the 2020 presidential election at a Monday meeting.

This marks the first time that the NSC will include an official dedicated to climate change.”
Murkowski statement: “A pressure campaign on state legislators to influence the electoral outcome is not only unprecedented but inconsistent with our democratic process. 
It is time to begin the full and formal transition process.”
My colleague @kaitlancollins is a dedicated journalist who always asks the right questions. 
It must be stated how disappointing it is to see outgoing 
@PressSec hurl insults  at reporters. 
Like so many admin employees she has forgotten she works for the American people. 
Not Trump.
Enjoyed the conversation. Thanks Michael. 
CNN: Georgia has finished its statewide audit, according to a press release from the GA Secretary of State’s office. 
President-elect Biden beat Trump by 12,284 votes, according to final results from the audit.
Outrageous that the VP would not take questions at a news briefing as the president is raising questions about the legitimacy of the election. 
“Are you on board with what Trump is doing or not?” is a question he should be prepared to answer.
Arizona’s Secretary of State says she’s getting death threats, calls on AZ Gov @dougducey to “stand up for the truth.”
Stewing in the WH, the lame duck president just fired a leading cybersecurity official in Chris Krebs who vouched for the security of US election. 
Trump still has more than two months before he has to go. 
Two more months to settle scores and potentially cause great damage.
Two years ago today... 
Federal judge ordered the WH to give back my press pass. 
Time flies... 


Go Jaden! Don’t stop!
Trump in Rose Garden sounded uncertain about the future of his admin, but still clinging to false hope he could somehow win an election he lost: 
"Whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be. 
I guess time will tell."
Trump claimed 306 electoral votes amounted to a "massive landslide" in 2016. 
CNN: 
Biden wins Georgia and Trump wins North Carolina. 
That projection gives Biden 306 electoral votes, same total Trump won in 2016.
WH says Trump will speak publicly at 4p in the Rose Garden. 
Topic will be COVID vaccine, WH says.
Update: 
Fauci says he will not be at WH for vaccine meeting with Trump today. 
He attended a virtual meeting on the vaccine this morning.
Totally bonkers.
CISA’s Krebs is telling people he doesn’t care if he is fired, I’m told, as he debunks Trump world claims. 
Senior admin official defended DHS statement on secure 2020 election adding “CISA sees its first principle as protecting democratic processes, not protecting an individual.”
DHS on 2020 election: 
“There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”
h/t to @maggieNYT who had this first.
Corey Lewandowski has tested positive for covid, he confirms. 
He says he feels fine and will be staying home.
We are through the looking glass here.
CNN: So far today, there have been at least 140,543 daily new coronavirus cases in the United States, per Johns Hopkins University data. 
This is the highest single day reporting since the pandemic began.
“A GoFundMe page created under Hopkins’s name had raised more than $136,000 by Tuesday evening, with donors praising him as a patriot and whistleblower. 
The fundraising page was removed by GoFundMe after this story was published Tuesday...”
Is this 2020 or 1984?
French President Emmanuel Macron called President-elect Biden today to congratulate him and Kamala Harris on their election, the Elysee Palace told CNN.
Biden now speaking by phone with US allies whose leaders see the former VP as the president-elect.
The president’s eldest son and his girlfriend have made it clear to campaign and WH officials they are unhappy with RNC chair Ronna McDaniel, who they view as not having done enough to win a close race.
“Don Junior and Kimberly have an eye on the RNC, through themselves taking over or somebody close to them taking over,” a well-placed Republican party source close to the WH said.
Three GOP sources, including close advisers to the president, say Donald Trump Junior and Kimberly Guilfoyle are making moves to expand their influence at the RNC, with sources saying they may seek to take over the party structure themselves.
Last week we reported Trump has spoken with aides about a comeback run in 2024
Reupping this from late last week. 
Adviser tonight says he sees a “path to losing.” 
Trump was more likely to have taken such a move had he beaten Joe Biden, I’m told. 
Wray was one of a number of top administration officials whose firings were discussed, the source said.
A source close to the president tells CNN Trump and his top aides did have discussions about firing the FBI director Christopher Wray that occurred prior to the election. 
The conversations about firing Wray appeared to hinge on Trump winning the election, I am told.
McConnell says Trump is “100 percent within his rights” to weigh his legal options.
Former SecDef Esper says he wasn't into the "dear leader" stuff when he was in charge at Pentagon, telling Military Times: 
"Have you seen me on a stage saying, ‘Under the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?’"
Re-upping from last Friday.
Trump has fired the Secretary of Defense.
President-elect Biden on COVID: 
"I implore you... wear a mask... 
A mask is not a political statement."
For younger readers who have been confused by the term “fake news...” this deleted tweet from a Trump campaign spokesman showing a doctored newspaper front page is a textbook example of actual “fake news.” The newspaper corrects the record below...
Sad news. 
Alex Trebek, long-running 'Jeopardy' host, has died. 
CNN: On Saturday, Johns Hopkins University reported 126,742 new cases of the coronavirus and 1040 new deaths.
Biden: “let’s give each other a chance.”

But Trump is digging in, I'm told.
Sources close to the White House said some senior officials inside the White House and the campaign are beginning to quietly back away from Trump, in acts of self-preservation, as the returns in Pennsylvania and Georgia indicate the President will not win reelection.

CNN: Biden's lead increasing slightly in NV. Now roughly up 12k.
How it started / how it’s going https://t.co/2bUpmUfWyW
GA GOP says it's filed lawsuit to stop counting of ballots in GA. 
Actually a ham sandwich sounds pretty good right now.
Trump campaign sounding increasingly desperate in its hopes for Arizona. 
An adviser just described it to me as “the OK corral...” something of a last stand for the president.
CNN: Biden wins Michigan.
Biden: "We are not enemies."
Biden: "I'm not here to declare we won. 
But I am here to report that when the count is finished we believe we will be the winner."
One problem for Trump campaign... it's seeking to halt counting in some areas and encouraging counting in others, an inconsistency that would be noted by just about any judge hearing these cases... if they get to court.
The Trump lawyers are trying to hang on to the blue wall.
Trump campaign says it’s making some legal moves in Pennsylvania to challenge mail-in ballot deadline there 
CNN: Biden wins Wisconsin.

"Words cannot describe the anger," the adviser said.
CNN: Biden wins VA.
Hillary Clinton barely won NH four years ago. 
CNN: Biden wins New Hampshire.
It's early and returns are still coming in.  
But hearing concerns from Trump adviser about Michigan and Wisconsin, and possibly Georgia and North Carolina. 
Asked about Ohio, adviser said "maybe" that state too. 
Others in campaign more confident.
CNN: So far today, Johns Hopkins has reported 86,492 new cases and 1,048 reported deaths.
On this Election Day I’m thinking about my dad who was just a kid when he fled Cuba, a place with no freedom of the press and where the leaders decide who’s in charge. 
We are lucky to be Americans.
Trump says Mexico will pay for the wall, something he promised four years ago. 
Never happened.

Omfg indeed.
On the night before Election Day twitter puts a warning label on Trump’s tweet on PA ballots saying it “might be misleading.”

"They made a very dangerous situation. 
And I mean, dangerous physically dangerous and they made it a very very bad they did a very bad thing for the state."
Trump in Scranton upset with celebrities supporting Democrats: 
"I can tell you stories about Lady Gaga."
Just what I needed to see on one of my last flights of campaign. 
Nice doggies!
Grievance fest for Trump in NC as he complains about Russia investigation, impeachment and media coverage.
Trump still fixated on poll showing him down 17 in Wisconsin. 
At NC rally he wonders why polls can’t just show him trailing by a slim margin. 
Breathtaking misinformation about how polling works.
My colleague @Kevinliptakcnn who was traveling with the WH pool also had to make his way through crowd to exit the same rally and says some supporters were pretending to cough and laughing as press was leaving the area. 
Disgraceful.
This is rally roulette. 
Check out this video from @mattyhoyeCNN at Trump rally in GA. 
We had to make our own path through a massive crowd of Trump supporters. It was wall to wall people. 
Zero social distancing. 
Just a few folks here and there wearing masks.

This is now the highest number of new cases reported in a single day since the pandemic began.
One of the shortest Trump rallies I’ve ever witnessed. 
Only 21 minutes.
People of twitter reminding me he was up at 3am tweeting. 
Trump appears very tired at this rally in MN, slowly moving through his prepared remarks.
Trump just got in motorcade. 
Appears to be heading to overflow crowd gathered outside event where they are not doing social distancing.

CNN: So far today, there have been 83,757 daily new coronavirus cases in the United States, per Johns Hopkins University data. 
This is now the highest single day reporting since the pandemic began.
This happens at just about every Trump rally. 
I’ve covered five presidential campaigns... long enough to know this isn’t normal. 
Sometimes I’ll scan the crowd, not for the folks who are chanting but for the people who look back at me silently, letting me know they know it’s wrong
Thank you Peter!
At Trump rally in Phoenix area, I was told by a supporter of the president to “get the hell out of our country.” 
Tell that to my grandfather who is buried at Arlington and my dad who fled to the US as a refugee from Cuba.
Trump in overdrive in complaining about his media coverage at Phoenix area rally: 
“We don’t have freedom of the press. 
It’s suppression of the press.”
Trump on Miles Taylor at Phoenix area rally: 
“he should be prosecuted.”
Once again no social distancing and most Trump supporters not wearing masks at this rally in Phoenix area.
On background: no.
I would like the answer to this too... 
“Anonymous” reveals his identify.
Trump continues to complain about coronavirus news coverage, again saying "Covid, covid, covid" at rally in Michigan.

Adds his admin did a "really good job" on virus.

"This would not have happened with Roger Ailes."

Trump is not dealing with the reality of the situation.

They’re going to be great. But with or without, and we're rounding the turn.”
CNN: On Friday, Johns Hopkins University reported 83,757 new cases and 943 new deaths. 
This is now the highest number of new cases reported in a single day since the pandemic began.

This masked Trump staffer is tossing out free hats to crowd in Pensacola. Perhaps he should be tossing out masks? 
Very few masks and zero social distancing at Trump rally in Pensacola. 
(So far today as of this tweet Johns Hopkins has reported 69,359 new cases and 781 reported deaths)
Not mooch time left. 
Trump who just insulted migrants at debate: “I am the least racist person in this room.”
Offensive remark from Trump on undocumented migrants who show up for their court dates: “Only those with the lowest IQ.”
On Trump admin policy of family separation and recent report that over 500 kids still have not been reunited with parents, Biden: “those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. It’s criminal.”
Biden’s repeated use of “come on” is this debate’s “malarkey.”
Trump claims again he was joking about Americans injecting themselves with disinfectants. Fact check: He was not joking.
Trump says he takes “full responsibility” for his response to pandemic after previously saying he didn’t take responsibility.
Both campaigns agreed to have plexiglass removed after consulting with Doctor Fauci, a source involved confirms to CNN. 
The plexiglass was deemed not necessary by Fauci as both Trump and Biden have tested negative.
WH COS Meadows told WH pool Trump tested negative for virus en route to Nashville for debate.
Trump lied repeatedly throughout the 60 Minutes interview on COVID, crowd sizes, health care, etc.
Stahl pushed him and fact-checked him which is why he's upset.
Biden campaign: 
On Saturday, October 24, President Obama will travel to Miami, Florida to campaign on behalf of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Before Trump started trashing Dr. Anthony Fauci this week as a "disaster," the two men spoke during Trump Covid-19…

They’d call me Beijing Barry.”

Looking forward to watching her moderate Thursday’s debate.
Ex-RNC Chairman Michael Steele endorses Biden with two weeks left in the election -  w/ @maeganvaz
Some Trump advisers simply could not figure out why Trump was attacking Fauci today with two weeks left in campaign. 
“Time is running out," one adviser told me. 
“Time is our enemy.”
On tarmac in Phoenix, Trump sounding angry, calling Joe Biden "a criminal" and accusing the press of being criminals for not covering his attacks on Biden.
Thanks Amy!
Extraordinary @Amy_Siskind list of norms  Trump abandoned in Washington Post
CNN: Johns Hopkins University reported 69,156 new total cases of coronavirus in the US on Friday... the highest case total since July 29th, when there were 71,302 new cases reported.
Given multiple opportunities, Trump refused to denounce Qanon at town hall.
Responding to Trump calling him a democrat, Fauci to CNN: “I am not registered with any political party.”
I talked to Trump supporters in Des Moines before the rally last night about the risks of attending a potential superspreader event. 
As one of his supporters told me, “If I'm gonna get sick and die, I guess it's my turn.”
What a Trump supporter told us heading into Iowa rally... 👇🏻 https://t.co/ZVffVZ0kgI
Billboard outside Des Moines airport where Trump holds Iowa rally tonight. 
“That date was fixed as the first Tuesday after Nov. 1 by an act of Congress in 1845 and cannot be changed—not by state election officials—absent new legislation.”
Waiting for Trump rally outside Orlando, very few supporters wearing masks, including many senior citizens. 
Just saw a Trump ad that features Fauci endorsing his handling of virus. 
Trump has sidelined Fauci in favor of people like Scott Atlas who has spread misinformation about COVID. 
Is Fauci aware he’s being used in a Trump ad?
Trump fundraising off of WH doctor clearing him to campaign again
WH doctor says Trump “no longer considered a transmission risk to others...” 
From balcony at WH, Trump told crowd the virus is “disappearing.” 
But that’s not true. 
Yesterday, Johns Hopkins reported 990 deaths and 57,420 new cases, a high level of spread that continues to worry health experts. 
Trump and top aides are still recovering from COVID-19
Next week’s presidential debate is now officially scrapped, the debate commission says.
Trump is expected to address the attendees from the balcony overlooking the South Lawn, the official added.
Trump expected to host event at WH tomorrow, a WH official confirms.
Fascinating
WH doctor says Trump on track to go back to “public engagements” on Saturday... ie campaign trail.
At gaggle, WH Comms Dir. Alyssa Farah declined to specify when Trump last tested negative, telling reporters: 
“I can’t reveal that at this time. The doctors would like to keep it private."
Trump is ranting about Hillary Clinton’s emails... less than four weeks before 2020 Election.
Trump on his current condition: 
“I’m almost not taking anything.”
Trump on Harris: 
“She wants to open up the borders to allow killers, murderers and rapists into our country.”
Trump says he doesn’t like idea of virtual debate because “they cut you off whenever they want.”
Trump says no to virtual debate.
Cutting the mics would be nice... but the debate moderators really need a lie swatter.
Pence repeats WH talking points on “very fine people on both sides.” 
Trump equivocated on white supremacy in his multiple statements on the violence in Charlottesville. 
It’s why both members of both parties were shocked back then. 
Trump has continued this pattern ever since.
Harris hitting Trump for “stand back and stand by” comment on Proud Boys at last debate: 
“this is part of a pattern.”
Pence didn’t answer question on preexisting conditions
“Mr Vice President, I’m speaking,” 
Harris has said often tonight.
Pence did not answer question on Roe v Wade.
Both Trump and Pence disregarding the rules of the debates.
Pence echoing big energy talking points on the subject of climate change: 
“the climate is changing. 
We’ll follow the science.” 
That’s not answering the question.
Pence calls Obamacare a “disaster” though polls show it’s become popular, including the law’s protections for preexisting conditions.
Harris on Trump’s assault on Obamacare: 
“they’re coming for you.”
Trump also says during the video that he "got back a day ago from Walter Reed medical center.” 
Yet, COS Meadows says Trump recorded the video today.
In his WH produced video, Trump praises the experimental medication he's been on, saying of COVID: 
"I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it."  
Trump has access to medical care not available to most Americans.
Marine is stationed outside West Wing. 
Trump is in the Oval. 
He’s being briefed on stimulus talks and hurricane.
Update from WH doctor on Trump: 
“the president this morning says ‘I feel great!’” 
Our colleague @abdallahcnn got this video of the #whitehouseraccoons last night.
Must watch... my colleague @joejohnscnn versus White House raccoons. 
Thanks for keeping us safe Joe!
Statement from Stephen Miller: 
“Over the last 5 days I have been working remotely and self-isolating, testing negative every day through yesterday.  
Today, I tested positive for COVID-19 and am in quarantine."
Biden in Gettysburg: 
"Wearing a mask is not a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation."
Pence team objects to plexiglass being installed for both VP and Sen. Harris at upcoming debate, we've confirmed.  
Pence officials don't have a problem if Harris would like plexiglass to protect her at debate.  
But Pence team believes it's not necessary for VP to have that too.
RIP Eddie Van Halen. Loved Van Halen growing up... sad news.
Unclear when he would do it. 
But a Trump address is under serious consideration, a senior campaign official confirmed. 
There are lingering health concerns given Trump’s apparent trouble breathing last night, the official and a separate source close to WH said.
Coronavirus in Chief, Trump takes off mask as he returns to WH.
Trump is likely instructing Conley what to disclose and not disclose, per our sources.
Dr. Conley repeatedly would not answer when Trump's last negative test was.
Declining to answer some questions from reporters at medical briefing, Dr. Conley sounding very optimistic once again on Trump's condition, saying "he's back."
Trump says he's leaving the hospital...
WH spox Judd Deere: 
“Dr. Sean Conley, Physician to the President, is expected to provide an update on the President’s condition in the 3 p.m. hour at Walter Reed."
Upper and Lower Press areas of West Wing for press and communications staffers are almost entirely empty as those employees are working remotely from home as a precaution. 
These areas are typically very busy with members of press and WH staffers interacting daily.
She was not wearing a mask during a gaggle with reporters yesterday.
The WH press secretary says she has tested positive for COVID.
Trump in that video message right before this ride: 
“I learned a lot about COVID...”
When asked why he offered such a rosy assessment of Trump’s status yesterday, Doctor Conley admitted he wanted to convey the “upbeat attitude” of Trump’s medical team.
One source described Trump as being “rip pissed” with Meadows handling of the response. 
Meadows is now widely seen inside WH as having been the official who anonymously contradicted WH physician Dr. Sean Conley.
Trump is furious with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows after the top West Wing official contradicted WH physician Dr, Sean Conley’s assessment of the president on Saturday, two sources with knowledge of the situation told CNN.
Source close to the WH confirmed Trump has received supplemental oxygen Friday. 
Trump “definitely has had oxygen,” the source said. 
Last night CNN reported Trump had been having trouble breathing.
WH doc: “I incorrectly used the term “seventy two hours” instead of “day three” and “fourth eight hours” instead of “day two” with regards to his diagnosis and the administrations of the polyclonal antibody therapy.”
Asked about this comment, a senior WH official said: “some of the vital signs early Friday were concerning and indicated a potential for a more serious progression of the disease.”
The print pool received the quote as well. 
It’s astounding that this quote was put on background. 
WH needs to clear this up ASAP.
The WH TV pool just received this quote from “a source familiar with the President's health...” - “The President's vitals over last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. 
We are still not on a clear path to a full recovery."
Doctor Conley would not definitively say whether Trump received supplemental oxygen during this covid illness. 
Though he did say he is not currently on oxygen.
Senator Scott’s spokesman says he did not test positive.
Senator Ron Johnson has tested positive for COVID, his office says.
Get well @shearm !!
WH official says Trump is “fatigued” but not deteriorating. 
The official went on to say public should not be alarmed and that Trump is taking the situation “very seriously.” WH is making plans to keep the public updated on his condition.
Trump adviser said there is reason for concern about Trump's health tonight. 
 "This is serious," the source said. 
 The source went on to describe Trump as very tired, very fatigued, and having some trouble breathing. 
WH officials continue to say Trump will be fine.
WH officials have serious concerns about Trump's condition tonight and his symptoms are worse than those of the First Lady at this point, according to our sources.

Biden tells @RussWKYC Trump’s attacks on Hunter Biden were “viciously classless...”
Trump “was likely the largest driver of the COVID-19 misinformation 'infodemic,’ ” study says.
One night after failing to condemn white supremacy at the debate, Trump is falsely alleging that Biden will flood Minnesota with refugees. 
Same playbook. 
Different night.
At rally in Minnesota Trump says Biden is canceling the next two debates despite the fact that the Biden campaign says he’ll be there.
Trump adviser on Trump’s proud boys comments last night: “Fuck the proud boys. 
There I said it.
Not that hard.”
Trump’s failure to condemn white supremacy at last night’s debate was not a slip of the tongue. 
It’s part of a pattern... perhaps best illustrated by his response to Charlottesville.
The Proud Boys are celebrating after last night’s debate...
Trump didn’t condemn white suprematists when given the chance, simply saying the Proud Boys should “stand back and stand by.”
As Trump goes after Hunter Biden, Joe Biden responds: “it’s hard to get any word in with this clown.”
Biden to Trump: “You’re the worst president America has ever had.”
Biden: “maybe you can inject some bleach in your arm.” Trump: “that was said sarcastically.”
Biden to Trump at first debate: “will you shut up man?”
A Trump campaign adviser said the president must make up some ground at tonight's debate with Biden. 
The adviser pointed to some recent polls showing Trump running behind Biden in key battleground states, including PA. 
"He needs the debate to break his way," Trump adviser said.
A tweet for everything... even debate night. 
I asked the question that resulted in Trump making that infamous “Russia if you’re listening” comment. 
The reporters at the news conference didn’t laugh. 
And Trump didn’t appear to be joking.
Coming up...
Last week we reported Dr. Birx was concerned Atlas is feeding Trump bad information. 
Earlier today, NBC reported CDC Dir. Redfield has similar concerns. 
Moments ago, Fauci suggested there is an "outlier" on the task force.
More on @CNN at top of hour.
Doctor Fauci just told our @brianstelter he's worried Trump is being given incorrect information about the pandemic pandemic.
Fauci, Birx and Redfield were not present for COVID event in Rose Garden this afternoon.
Atlas was.
We'll discuss at top of hour on @CNNSitRoom -- 
I'm in for Wolf.
Trump denies he’s only paid hundreds of dollars in taxes as reported in NYT, going on to repeat his excuse for why he doesn’t release his tax returns to public:  “they’re under audit.” 
At campaign event in Atlanta, Trump supporters chanted "12 more years" as he mocked press coverage of his refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
Leaving for NC, Trump claimed he couldn't really hear booing at SCOTUS today: "I think that was just a political chant. We could hardly hear it from where we were..Somebody said there was some chanting. But they were right next to the media. But we could hardly hear too much." 
Trump on why mail-in ballots are ok in Florida last month: "So Florida's got a great Republican governor and it had a great Republican governor."  
Good to see @BrianKarem was able to keep his White House press pass and ask such an important question.
Fact check: that’s my friend @PeterAlexander 
Trump tells reporters he wants a replacement for RBG quickly as he believes 2020 election will end up going to SCOTUS: “Yes, I think it’s very important. I think this will end up in the Supreme Court and I think it’s very important that we have nine justices." 
On our story that Birx is so distressed she is unsure if she can stay on task force, WH spokesman Judd Deere: "President Trump relies on the advice and counsel of all of his top health officials every day and any suggestion that their role is being diminished is just false." 
According to people familiar with her thinking, Birx views Dr. Scott Atlas, a recent addition to the task force, as an unhealthy influence on President Donald Trump's thinking when it comes to the virus. 
“Don’t think of it as the warmest month of August in California in the last century,” he wrote. “Think of it as one of the coolest months of August in California in the next century.” 
Troye is disputing what Kellogg said at briefing. The General refused to take questions from reporters after he trashed Troye from the podium. 
Top contender for SCOTUS pick, Amy Coney Barrett was at WH today, we've confirmed. Trump is hinting at speedy timeline for SCOTUS pick, telling reporters at departure on South Lawn:  “I’d rather see it all take place before the election.” 
Manchin: “For the sake of the integrity of our courts and legal system, I do not believe the U.S. Senate should vote on a U.S. Supreme Court nominee before the November 3rd election." 
Biden really driving for some middle class voters in this speech: "About time a state school president sits in the Oval Office." Biden on Trump as US reaches 200,000 deaths from COVID-19: "Trump panicked. The virus is too big for him… he just wasn't up to it. He froze."
