A longtime Trump adviser on Trump‚Äôs tweets instructing GSA to begin transition: 
‚Äúthere you go. It‚Äôs over.‚Äù 
The GSA press office is describing the letter from @GSAEmily as a ‚Äúletter of ascertainment...‚Äù 
This is the most open Trump has sounded about a transition since the election. 
Of course Trump being Trump he could totally reverse course.  
And there almost two months to go before Jan 20.
Our @KristenhCNN reporting that GSA has informed Biden team in letter to begin transition and has notified WH COS Meadows in that same letter that GSA is starting the process.

Not Trump.
Enjoyed the conversation. Thanks Michael. 
CNN: Georgia has finished its statewide audit, according to a press release from the GA Secretary of State‚Äôs office. 
President-elect Biden beat Trump by 12,284 votes, according to final results from the audit.
Outrageous that the VP would not take questions at a news briefing as the president is raising questions about the legitimacy of the election. 
‚ÄúAre you on board with what Trump is doing or not?‚Äù is a question he should be prepared to answer.

Trump in Rose Garden sounded uncertain about the future of his admin, but still clinging to false hope he could somehow win an election he lost: 
"Whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be. 
I guess time will tell."
Trump claimed 306 electoral votes amounted to a "massive landslide" in 2016. 
CNN: 
Biden wins Georgia and Trump wins North Carolina. 
That projection gives Biden 306 electoral votes, same total Trump won in 2016.
WH says Trump will speak publicly at 4p in the Rose Garden. 
Topic will be COVID vaccine, WH says.
Update: 
Fauci says he will not be at WH for vaccine meeting with Trump today. 
He attended a virtual meeting on the vaccine this morning.

Three GOP sources, including close advisers to the president, say Donald Trump Junior and Kimberly Guilfoyle are making moves to expand their influence at the RNC, with sources saying they may seek to take over the party structure themselves.

Re-upping from last Friday.
Trump has fired the Secretary of Defense.
President-elect Biden on COVID:

A mask is not a political statement."
For younger readers who have been confused by the term ‚Äúfake news...‚Äù this deleted tweet from a Trump campaign spokesman showing a doctored newspaper front page is a textbook example of actual ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù The newspaper corrects the record below...

Biden: "We are not enemies."
Biden: "I'm not here to declare we won.

The Trump lawyers are trying to hang on to the blue wall.

Upper and Lower Press areas of West Wing for press and communications staffers are almost entirely empty as those employees are working remotely from home as a precaution. 
These areas are typically very busy with members of press and WH staffers interacting daily.
She was not wearing a mask during a gaggle with reporters yesterday.
The WH press secretary says she has tested positive for COVID.
Trump in that video message right before this ride: 
‚ÄúI learned a lot about COVID...‚Äù
When asked why he offered such a rosy assessment of Trump‚Äôs status yesterday, Doctor Conley admitted he wanted to convey the ‚Äúupbeat attitude‚Äù of Trump‚Äôs medical team.
One source described Trump as being ‚Äúrip pissed‚Äù with Meadows handling of the response. 
Meadows is now widely seen inside WH as having been the official who anonymously contradicted WH physician Dr. Sean Conley.
Trump is furious with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows after the top West Wing official contradicted WH physician Dr, Sean Conley‚Äôs assessment of the president on Saturday, two sources with knowledge of the situation told CNN.
Source close to the WH confirmed Trump has received supplemental oxygen Friday. 
Trump ‚Äúdefinitely has had oxygen,‚Äù the source said. 
Last night CNN reported Trump had been having trouble breathing.
WH doc: ‚ÄúI incorrectly used the term ‚Äúseventy two hours‚Äù instead of ‚Äúday three‚Äù and ‚Äúfourth eight hours‚Äù instead of ‚Äúday two‚Äù with regards to his diagnosis and the administrations of the polyclonal antibody therapy.‚Äù
Asked about this comment, a senior WH official said: ‚Äúsome of the vital signs early Friday were concerning and indicated a potential for a more serious progression of the disease.‚Äù
The print pool received the quote as well. 
It‚Äôs astounding that this quote was put on background. 
WH needs to clear this up ASAP.
The WH TV pool just received this quote from ‚Äúa source familiar with the President's health...‚Äù - ‚ÄúThe President's vitals over last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. 
We are still not on a clear path to a full recovery."
Doctor Conley would not definitively say whether Trump received supplemental oxygen during this covid illness. 
Though he did say he is not currently on oxygen.
Senator Scott‚Äôs spokesman says he did not test positive.
Senator Ron Johnson has tested positive for COVID, his office says.
Get well @shearm !!
WH official says Trump is ‚Äúfatigued‚Äù but not deteriorating. 
The official went on to say public should not be alarmed and that Trump is taking the situation ‚Äúvery seriously.‚Äù WH is making plans to keep the public updated on his condition.
Trump adviser said there is reason for concern about Trump's health tonight. 
 "This is serious," the source said. 
 The source went on to describe Trump as very tired, very fatigued, and having some trouble breathing. 
WH officials continue to say Trump will be fine.
WH officials have serious concerns about Trump's condition tonight and his symptoms are worse than those of the First Lady at this point, according to our sources.

More Meadows: "what you have is a virus that is contagious, that certainly continues to be, regardless of whatever protocol we have, that it has the ability to affect everybody, as you know, the President, we keep a pretty wide circle."
First Lady is now also confirming she's experiencing symptoms.
Meadows on why no mask: "So I've obviously been tested, we're hopefully more than six feet away. 
And if there's ny, concern there, from a guidance standpoint, we have protocols in place.‚Äù

Biden tells @RussWKYC Trump‚Äôs attacks on Hunter Biden were ‚Äúviciously classless...‚Äù
Trump ‚Äúwas likely the largest driver of the COVID-19 misinformation 'infodemic,‚Äô ‚Äù study says.
One night after failing to condemn white supremacy at the debate, Trump is falsely alleging that Biden will flood Minnesota with refugees. 
Same playbook. 
Different night.
At rally in Minnesota Trump says Biden is canceling the next two debates despite the fact that the Biden campaign says he‚Äôll be there.
Trump adviser on Trump‚Äôs proud boys comments last night: ‚ÄúFuck the proud boys. 
There I said it.
Not that hard.‚Äù
Trump‚Äôs failure to condemn white supremacy at last night‚Äôs debate was not a slip of the tongue. 
It‚Äôs part of a pattern... perhaps best illustrated by his response to Charlottesville.
The Proud Boys are celebrating after last night‚Äôs debate...
Trump didn‚Äôt condemn white suprematists when given the chance, simply saying the Proud Boys should ‚Äústand back and stand by.‚Äù
As Trump goes after Hunter Biden, Joe Biden responds: ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to get any word in with this clown.‚Äù
Biden to Trump: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst president America has ever had.‚Äù
Biden: ‚Äúmaybe you can inject some bleach in your arm.‚Äù Trump: ‚Äúthat was said sarcastically.‚Äù
Biden to Trump at first debate: ‚Äúwill you shut up man?‚Äù
A Trump campaign adviser said the president must make up some ground at tonight's debate with Biden. 
The adviser pointed to some recent polls showing Trump running behind Biden in key battleground states, including PA. 
"He needs the debate to break his way," Trump adviser said.
A tweet for everything... even debate night. 
I asked the question that resulted in Trump making that infamous ‚ÄúRussia if you‚Äôre listening‚Äù comment. 
The reporters at the news conference didn‚Äôt laugh. 
And Trump didn‚Äôt appear to be joking.
Coming up...
Last week we reported Dr. Birx was concerned Atlas is feeding Trump bad information. 
Earlier today, NBC reported CDC Dir. Redfield has similar concerns. 
Moments ago, Fauci suggested there is an "outlier" on the task force.
More on @CNN at top of hour.
Doctor Fauci just told our @brianstelter he's worried Trump is being given incorrect information about the pandemic pandemic.
Fauci, Birx and Redfield were not present for COVID event in Rose Garden this afternoon.
Atlas was.
We'll discuss at top of hour on @CNNSitRoom -- 
I'm in for Wolf.
Trump denies he‚Äôs only paid hundreds of dollars in taxes as reported in NYT, going on to repeat his excuse for why he doesn‚Äôt release his tax returns to public:  ‚Äúthey‚Äôre under audit.‚Äù 
At campaign event in Atlanta, Trump supporters chanted "12 more years" as he mocked press coverage of his refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
Leaving for NC, Trump claimed he couldn't really hear booing at SCOTUS today: "I think that was just a political chant. We could hardly hear it from where we were..Somebody said there was some chanting. But they were right next to the media. But we could hardly hear too much." 
Trump on why mail-in ballots are ok in Florida last month: "So Florida's got a great Republican governor and it had a great Republican governor."  
Good to see @BrianKarem was able to keep his White House press pass and ask such an important question.
Fact check: that‚Äôs my friend @PeterAlexander 
Trump tells reporters he wants a replacement for RBG quickly as he believes 2020 election will end up going to SCOTUS: ‚ÄúYes, I think it‚Äôs very important. I think this will end up in the Supreme Court and I think it‚Äôs very important that we have nine justices." 
On our story that Birx is so distressed she is unsure if she can stay on task force, WH spokesman Judd Deere: "President Trump relies on the advice and counsel of all of his top health officials every day and any suggestion that their role is being diminished is just false." 
According to people familiar with her thinking, Birx views Dr. Scott Atlas, a recent addition to the task force, as an unhealthy influence on President Donald Trump's thinking when it comes to the virus. 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think of it as the warmest month of August in California in the last century,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThink of it as one of the coolest months of August in California in the next century.‚Äù 
Troye is disputing what Kellogg said at briefing. The General refused to take questions from reporters after he trashed Troye from the podium. 
Top contender for SCOTUS pick, Amy Coney Barrett was at WH today, we've confirmed. Trump is hinting at speedy timeline for SCOTUS pick, telling reporters at departure on South Lawn:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather see it all take place before the election.‚Äù 
Manchin: ‚ÄúFor the sake of the integrity of our courts and legal system, I do not believe the U.S. Senate should vote on a U.S. Supreme Court nominee before the November 3rd election." 
Biden really driving for some middle class voters in this speech: "About time a state school president sits in the Oval Office." Biden on Trump as US reaches 200,000 deaths from COVID-19: "Trump panicked. The virus is too big for him‚Ä¶ he just wasn't up to it. He froze."
