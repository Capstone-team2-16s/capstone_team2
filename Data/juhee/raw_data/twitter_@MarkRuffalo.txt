Since the 2016 election, headline after headline described escalating acts of political violence committed by Trump's supporters and by those who share his hateful worldview ‚Äî headlines so frequent and relentless as to make them routine.


Nothing solid there. 
He is a mirage. 
He consumes everything that goes near him. 
He lifts nothing and sinks everything that comes into contact with him.

The economic system we are living under sucks for everyone but these 50 people. 
I know, you think you are maybe going to one day become one of them. 
I hate to break it to you. 
The game is rigged against you.

And while you are at it, Wolf, let's make sure to remind people that our President not only refused to condemn White Supremacy but he also called out fascist thugs to "Stand By'.

That's way past "embarrassing" at this point and had zero to do with Biden's debate performance.

Be an Anti-Fascist in all you do.


I'm doing everything in my power to push back.

Say it.

We are all facing chaos.
Trump offers only more chaos.
Festering Chaos.

Reach out folks, see who is next to you, and hold tight.

Hold tight to the goodness, fairness, decency and love,  that always has conquered the darkness of chaos.

We must gather together now, shoulder to shoulder and arm in arm.

Together as humankind, to say ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù to this chaos and hold tight and bravely against it.

Like this we win.

The time is coming for us to rise together to the goodness of our nation.

To rise above this chaos and gather in the strength of our Unity.

I know this is hard to get your head around, but let‚Äôs be honest, our President is a Fascist Dictator.

Who has a fascist gang of thugs standing by.
Real.

People are becoming their own heroes.

It‚Äôs that we love justice, fairness, and morality.
Somewhere along the line you left those things behind.
It‚Äôs sad but the truth is we are better without you and South Carolina needs some new blood, not an entrenched career guy.


Pennsylvania friends: be aware that PA uses a two-envelope mail ballot system: A completed ballot goes into a ‚Äúsecrecy envelope‚Äù that has no identifying information, and then into a larger mailing envelope that the voter signs.

We must center communities of color in our climate action; they are who are most affected by the Climate Crisis.¬†s well as who are already creating solutions!
