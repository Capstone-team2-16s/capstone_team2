With today‚Äôs news from the White House where they have  admitted to giving up on Covid prevention all together, this shit isn‚Äôt funny, it‚Äôs just deadly.
So the WH, who says they have done a great job controlling Covid, is now saying they have lost control. 
They never had it in control. 
The new message is ‚Äúgive up preventing it and deal with it when you are sick and maybe dying‚Äù. 
The poor, old and sick will die. 
Shameful bastards.

@CindyHydeSmith really doesn't want to answer the question if fighting to keep slaves was the best part of Mississippi history. 
There is nothing good or noble about it. 
It's time to turn the page on fetishizing slavery and the Confederacy's fight to keep it going. 
It's ugly.
It would create A LOT of new jobs.

The difference between Biden and Trump is clear. 
Biden is the candidate of possibility.
Trump tells us it‚Äôs not his fault, it doesn‚Äôt exist or it‚Äôs impossible to fix. 
From Climate Change, Police Reform, Covid,Racism, Trump offers nothing. 
Biden has plans to address all of them.
You are absolutely right. 
Thank you, Blair.
Dear Blair, you are right on here. 
That is profound and true. 
I stand corrected. 
I always learn from you and always come away more mindful of the power and depth of our words and what they mean. 
But also what is being left out of the conversation. 
Thank you.

Stop whining about the IRS, and RELEASE YOUR RETURNS. 
Yes, he called him the the most racist president in modern history. 
That did happen.

#Debates2020
Natural gas is not only dirty it's 70x more heat trapping than CO2. 
#Debates2020 Fracking still sucks by the way.
Trump calls Climate Change a hoax. 
The Green New Deal was based on science and will create 5 million new jobs for our young people. 
Retrofitting buildings Pay for themselves. 
#Debates2020
Our water is more polluted than it has ever been, Lead, PFAS and radio active material from fracking is poisoning our families while Trump is destroying clean water protections. 
It's a bold faced lie what he saying about the water. 
#Debates2020
This is the truth about Trump's environmental legacy. 
More than 200 million Americans could have toxic PFAS in their drinking water 
#Debates2020
Trump's racist comments about telling the suburbs that Corey Booker was going to ruin their neighborhoods with "Affordable Housing" is racist. 
#Debates2020
#BlackLivesMatter 
Trump has used race to repeatedly to tear this country up. 
He won't condemn Nazis he didn't condemn White Nationalists and he has told the racist Proud Boys to, "Stand By".
Trump is a liar, Biden is an honorable man who raised his boys on his own after his wife was killed in a car accident.
Exactly.
Let's talk about Trump trying to get the Central Park 5 murdered by the state. 
5 totally innocent men. 
#Debates2020
Family Separation is an amoral stain on this country that will be remembered throughtout time. 
It was a heinous and cruel and evil policy and it continues to be an evil and cruel policy with over 520 kids who have lost their families. #Debates2020
They have lost their parents! 
How can they be well taken care of? 
They are in fucking prisons, they are not "WELL TAKEN CARE OF". 
It's an atrocity. 
It's sick and it's a sin. 
#Debates2020
TRUMP and the GOP have torn 520 Children from their parents! 
They came with their parents. 
It's not Coyotes, it was their parents. 
This is an atrocity that TRUMP and GOP committed.
AMERICAN WORKERS DESERVE $15 per HOUR!
400K business have closed because Trump did not lead the country out of Covid.

Yes!! People in the richest country in the world need healthcare! 
Trump isn‚Äôt doing a damn thing for healthcare. 
#Debate2020

It expands insurance for everyone!

Not only are you not winning the House you are going to loose the Presidency.

Trump said he is getting rid of it.
Trump send love letters to North Korean dictator, he takes the word of Putin and of the Saudi murderer MBS as they kill our journalists and taking out bounties on our military men and women.
Donald Trump has foreign conflicts of interest. 
He has never put his corporations in a blind trust. 
His children are wildly involved in politics and his businesses. There is no firewall between them.

You did loose the Lincoln project people and the Never Trumpers, and a lot of the Vets you pissed off by calling them losers, you lost Lindsay Graham then you got him back. 
You did loose Ben Sasse but that‚Äôs just because he thought no one was listening. 
He will be back tomorrow.
To be fair Hollywood Elites James Woods and Clint Eastwood are for you. 
And Silicon Valley Elite Peter Thiel is for you. 
Convicted felons Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn and Trump‚Äôs old friend and dance partner Jeffrey Epstein as well as the Taliban, Nazis and the KKK.
The whole of the natural world is against you. 
Putin is for you and Steve Bannon is for you. 
Dictators and despots are also for you. 
Flies are for you. 
The Taliban and the KKK are for you and so are nazis and white supremacists. 
The Tic Tok kids are against you though.

Since the 2016 election, headline after headline described escalating acts of political violence committed by Trump's supporters and by those who share his hateful worldview ‚Äî headlines so frequent and relentless as to make them routine.


Nothing solid there. 
He is a mirage. 
He consumes everything that goes near him. 
He lifts nothing and sinks everything that comes into contact with him.

The economic system we are living under sucks for everyone but these 50 people. 
I know, you think you are maybe going to one day become one of them. 
I hate to break it to you. 
The game is rigged against you.

And while you are at it, Wolf, let's make sure to remind people that our President not only refused to condemn White Supremacy but he also called out fascist thugs to "Stand By'.

That's way past "embarrassing" at this point and had zero to do with Biden's debate performance.

Be an Anti-Fascist in all you do.


I'm doing everything in my power to push back.

Say it.

Do it.

We are all facing chaos.
Trump offers only more chaos.
Festering Chaos.

Reach out folks, see who is next to you, and hold tight.

Hold tight to the goodness, fairness, decency and love,  that always has conquered the darkness of chaos.

We must gather together now, shoulder to shoulder and arm in arm.

Together as humankind, to say ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù to this chaos and hold tight and bravely against it.

Like this we win.

The time is coming for us to rise together to the goodness of our nation.

To rise above this chaos and gather in the strength of our Unity.

I know this is hard to get your head around, but let‚Äôs be honest, our President is a Fascist Dictator.

Who has a fascist gang of thugs standing by.
Real.

People are becoming their own heroes.

It‚Äôs that we love justice, fairness, and morality.
Somewhere along the line you left those things behind.
It‚Äôs sad but the truth is we are better without you and South Carolina needs some new blood, not an entrenched career guy.


Pennsylvania friends: be aware that PA uses a two-envelope mail ballot system: A completed ballot goes into a ‚Äúsecrecy envelope‚Äù that has no identifying information, and then into a larger mailing envelope that the voter signs.

We must center communities of color in our climate action; they are who are most affected by the Climate Crisis.¬†s well as who are already creating solutions!
