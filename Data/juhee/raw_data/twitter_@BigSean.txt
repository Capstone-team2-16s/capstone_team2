People get used to crossing that line wit you like like it’s normal, then get to begging n pleading when they gotta face the repercussions like every cause ain’t got a effect!
But it’s not that easy huh
It’s not
Quickest cure for anxiety is to live in the moment...
Thank you bro! 
Long as people feel it then we already won! 
But dat would be fire too 🙏🏾💙🏁🤞🏾
That’s not true, it’s been a lot of orders delivered. 
but the real deal is that I been on them and checking everyday n they went through a Covid cutback n had to cut back production. 
It’s not me personally doing so I’m on them as much as possible to get them out ASAP. Love
It’s on the way guys! 
Production took a L with Covid, but the merch is quality and will be worth the wait I promise! 
This delay in delivery won’t happen again! Love
🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s like part 2! 
Same producer, that was my goal to give it that texture 🤟🏾🔥🌍💪🏾🌹

Next week 🐺
You know my favorite time to come through for ya is the clutch, last second what a rush!
It’s a lot of people I know who didn’t vote, I wonder if they’ll see how much their vote would have counted by the end of the night. 
They literally beat us, shot us, killed us, locked us up cause they didn’t want us to vote. 
That alone should show u how important it really is
For sure
If you in that long line to vote stay in it! 
The line that long because it’s that important 🤟🏾
Why I feel like some shit finna go down?! 
Y’all stay safe 🙏🏾💙

You only as complete as your plan ☝🏾
I been on them everyday about this. 
They are the slowest ever. 
It’s being made and sent out this week and next and some of the more detailed shirts and items at the end of the month. 
Took way longer than expected n they blamed it on Covid affecting the factory production. 
Love!
OTW
N holding grudges only hurt yourself. 
Sooner or later, they get what they deserve and you get what you deserve. 
Facts 🤟🏾
Yup!
It’s gonna come a time where you see who wit you and who REALLY wit you... big difference!
It’s shipping this week and next week! 
I just got a update. 
Some of the more detailed pieces ship closer to the end of the month. 
I been on them everyday making sure it gets out. 
They talking bout COVID slowed down production time so it’s taking longer than it should on their end
Yeah, all love. 
It’s taking too long but I just got a report today and most of it is shipping out this week, and next week. 
Some pieces took longer to make too
It’s pissing me off that it’s not all sent out yet. 
Since they pressed them up fresh it takes longer. 
they are telling me because of COVID their staff is short taking longer @ factories. 
Shit irritating as fuck, working on getting out ASAP. 
Love n thanks for ya patience!
Do that 🤞🏾
It’s pissing me off too, I been on them every couple hours doing the best I can. 
It’s getting to you soon as humanly possible. 
Thank you
KOBE!!!!

Why Would I Stop?!!!! #Detroit2 🔥
Yessir! It takes 4-6 weeks (says that on the site too). To press up n make fresh. 
I definitely wanted it to be done that way as opposed to just sitting around prior. 
It feels better and it’s cleaner n safer when it’s made 4 you, pressed up n shipped directly to you! 
More time tho
On God 🤞🏾
I hope this not real
Yup
It says 4 to 6 weeks on the site 😒.
I wanted them to print the merch fresh instead of having it sitting around.
It’s better when it’s made n pressed n shipped to you directly for you n also more sanitary.
Takes longer, but It’s better n safer that way  🤞🏾🌍🚀✊🏾🌹
🌎🚀📍Keep checking in, coming to a city near you!
