Breaking the games into 6 Half’s...

Lakers have won the first 3 and the Heat have won the last 3
I said Nuggets in 9 also

Heat have gotten better every game.

The Lakers played one of their best games of the season G1 (after the start) combine that with the injuries and thats why the score was so lopsided in G1.

They said I was crazy when I said G2 would have gone to the Heat if they were healthy 🤷🏽‍♂️

Hi-Chew’s are better than Starburst 
What’s your point?

🚨NEW EPISODE OUT🚨 

EPISODE 2 of @thesportsgap now live!!! 

His statement was this is the first time I’ve been on the court where someone else can make that shot...
that’s the issue, not was he the best option.

This is PROOF of leadership....

FYI our goal was to get Steph on Kyrie cuz we felt that was the best 1v1 matchup we had for the win and Kyrie delivered.

There’s plenty of “proof” of the statement being false

New Episode out of @TheSportsGap out tomorrow!
 

They do... Bam, Jimmy, Tyler, Jae, Dragic, Duncan ... Rondo and Dwight balled but all the guys I mentioned have this far had a better postseason than the third best play on the Lakers.

Cuz they don’t have an answer for 1-2 on the Lakers don’t mean I’m wrong 🤷🏽‍♂️

Sheesh... LAKERS IN 3

Let’s just say the Miami Heat playing small ball.... ISNT IT 


🤣😂


It’s crazy!
 The Miami Heat are what we thought the Clippers would be. Gritty, well coached, deep and balanced attack...
they are a problem!
 They’ve taken down Celtics and Milwaukee and only lost 3 games this postseason 🤯😱 

Lakers vs Heat in FINALS...LIKE IVE BEEN SAYING  Y’all better start listening 😏
Nuggets in 9
Lakers are undefeated when entering the 4th Quarter with a lead! ....52-0 😑😳
Me : I feel like the Nuggets are ok!
 What do you think?
