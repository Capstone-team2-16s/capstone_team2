I was nervous and prepared to be made fun of for certain things I open up about in my book, and I shared a preview of that in interviews this week.

But to my amazement I’ve received nothing but love and overwhelming support.

THANK YOU.

Thank you so much dear Roma 🕊 I am so blessed by your friendship and support.
It means the world to me.

Also, I can’t wait for you to read your part in it🙈 I love you so much ❤️

I share this in my book because I hope that it will help anyone from being taken advantage of.

I hope that by being brave and using my voice, I can help those that feel voiceless.
