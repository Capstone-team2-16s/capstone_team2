I was nervous and prepared to be made fun of for certain things I open up about in my book, and I shared a preview of that in interviews this week.

But to my amazement I’ve received nothing but love and overwhelming support.

THANK YOU.

I hope that by being brave and using my voice, I can help those that feel voiceless.
