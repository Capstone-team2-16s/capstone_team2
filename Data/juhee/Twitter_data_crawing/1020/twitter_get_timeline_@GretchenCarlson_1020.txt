Oh my ‚Äî questioner says trump is handsome when he smiles ... time to go to bed #townhall
Why do we make abortion political? 
I hate it. 
Like there‚Äôs no other topic that affects women in our nation. 
Why is all discussion about that? 
Like we as women don‚Äôt have anything else to offer. 
Please #townhall
Trump: ‚ÄúDid you ever hear the expression under-levered?‚Äù 
What a condescending question to @SavannahGuthrie
Switching to Biden #townhall ‚Äî it‚Äôs more sane and even keeled ... but whose watching?
Trump said he didn‚Äôt eat after a person brought him his meal and touched his mask ‚Äî 
yet he never wore a mask. 
#townhall
Gotta love the masked woman behind Trump nodding her head every time Trump says anything. 
#townhall
I love that @SavannahGuthrie is wearing pink!

The Thompsons have been farmers for more than 70 years. 
Scott Thompson now has 22 acres of flowers, seven of which haven't even bloomed yet creating 2 million blooms. 
The flowers are planted in more than 15 fields to provide room to social distance and spread out.

"My value system says it's not just an organ but a piece of me." 
A young woman donated her kidney after reading Sovereign Valentine's plead for an organ donation on social media and on cars.
A teenage bagger at a grocery store noticed an elderly customer fumbling around in her purse, coming up $20 short on a grocery bill of about $150. 
So, he stepped in and paid the rest of her balance.
It‚Äôs amazing what a single act of kindness can do to change someone‚Äôs destiny #goodnewswithgretchen

Hmm.
