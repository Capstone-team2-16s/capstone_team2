Key that EU mentions legal texts. UK has been very frustrated that EU up until now wouldn’t engage in starting to draft joint legal texts around (the considerable amount of) areas where there is agreement between the two sides 
#brexit
EU says it’s repeated its offer to hold intensified talks with U.K. negotiators .. 
Brussels waits to hear government reply👇
#brexit
EU has said many times it doesn’t care how PM ‘sells’ a deal he agrees with them. 
Brussels understands politics. Even if PM makes concessions (he will have to-as EU will too-to agree a deal) he’ll want to shout victory to help him sell the deal back home**See Withdrawal Agreement
If EU openly engages on fish, that’ll help UK engage in other tough issues  of greater importance to EU as a whole - like governance and level playing field -especially state aid. 
If the UK doesn’t budge at all - there’ll be no deal anyway
Important to EU coastal states was being SEEN by their fishing communities to be standing up for their rights in a deal with UK. 
Arguably they can now say they’ve done that but that now the chances of getting ANY deal and therefore ANY quotas at all in UK waters is at risk
But EU coastal states have been demanding that the UK move more on competition regulations BEFORE they openly talk fish concessions. 
Might they now move earlier with window closing on possibility of a deal and cost of no deal being far bigger than cost of smaller fish quotas?
It’s an open secret in EU circles -as Macron admitted on Friday -that it will have to compromise on fish. 
Fish will be a ‘win’ for the PM whatever the final deal looks like (if there is a deal in the end). 
Still to be negotiated is how big a UK win / EU compromise of cours
alluded to that at the summit? 
There’s little expectation in Brussels that real negotiations could now happen this week. 
At least first half. 
It’s been a frustration of EU chief negotiator Barnier that EU coastal nations wouldn’t let him start talking fish compromises already
It fundamentally changes its position. Is it enough to declare EU wants 
Intensive talks. 
If so, Barnier said that over + over in his press conference on Thursday) and EU admission that it needs to compromise too. Not only UK. 
If so, Angela Merkel and Dutch PM Mark Rutte
Yes, they did that to show they weren’t ‘bowing to UK pressure’ 
as one diplomat put it to me. 
Boris Johnson has declared the summit a deadline for talks. Not the EU. 
BUT that decision by EU leaders was clearly a misstep. 
The PM says the EU can now come to him if
EU must know PM needs to show a win here. 
It was short-sighted of EU leaders to put onus of compromising solely on the UK in their summit conclusions last week and to intentionally remove the word ‘intensive’ from their call to continue negotiations
eg dynamic alignment for state aid But UK must know Brussels will not compromise on protecting single market -not just in practical terms but also so other trade partners can see the EU has strict rules and more recalcitrant EU member states can see its serious too. 
Equally..
As @DavidHenigUK wrote this weekend. 
But the EU’s level playing field demands come as no surprise to UK. 
They were in the political declaration signed by both sides last year outlining intentions for their future relations. 
Brussels has rowed back on maximalist demands 
Big problem is that both sides are so suspicious of each other. 
EU doesn’t trust UK gov to keep its word (it points to Internal Market Bill as a case in point). 
UK accuses EU of not accepting its sovereignty and trying to keep post #Brexit UK tied to EU rules. 
Both have a point
EU+UK chief negotiators are speaking this afternoon. 
What will it take to re-start talks? 
I’d argue it’s not about specifics. 
It’s about political will. 
Do the PM and EU really want a deal? 
If answer is yes, then both sides know they must compromise + a deal is there to be done
Belgian Health Minister has announced on broadcaster RTL that as regards #Covid the government is no longer in control of what’s happening.

Macron says: The British have much more need of a post-Brexit deal than the EU. 
The EU is ready to continue negotiations. Our conditions are clear and well-known. 
It's now for the UK to choose if it wants a deal or not
Yes 👇 https://t.co/vWFXvkcNaq
For all those writing to me about Macron‘s tweet yesterday - here it is 👇 https://t.co/wAEnbv9yaQ
So: are EU-UK trade talks finished /done kaputt /over for good?👇 https://t.co/ebccdv5r8E
Interesting👇
I think EU assumed UK knew Brussels would move on fish in the end. 
It was tricky for Barnier‘s negotiating team. 
They wanted to move earlier on fish but were held back by EU coastal states esp France - who insisted on seeing UK compromise on competition rules first
New #covid restrictions in Belgium. 
Nationwide curfew from midnight to 5am. 
All cafes and restaurants shut for a month from Monday. 
One close personal contact allowed per month apart from people you live with.
Oui!
Indeed!!😆
Macron responds to PMs spokesman saying ‚trade talks are over’. 
Macron: „The British have much more need of a post-Brexit deal than the EU. 
The EU is ready to continue negotiations. Our conditions are clear and well-known. 
It's now for the UK to choose if it wants a deal or not“
Macron says the EU wants a deal which he says is why EU leaders authorised Michel Barnier to keep negotiating. 
But underlined Macron again: not a deal at any price #Brexit
"We're not going to negotiate through the media" was Angela Merkel's response when asked to react to Boris Johnson saying the EU needed to fundamentally change its attitude for negotiations to continue  #Brexit
Asked about Boris Johnson saying today that the UK should prepare for no deal with the EU - Angela Merkel said the EU is also prepared for no deal. 
Neither side wants a deal at any price she said but she said the EU and she personally thinks negotiations should continue #Brexit
She said leaders were trying to find ways to reduce person-to-person contacts in their countries (ie increased social restrictions) to reduce the number of individuals who have to be traced when someone tests positive for covid 
Merkel says all EU leaders at summit agreed test and trace is currently the best way to try and control spread of #covid
Angela Merkel in her post summit press conference says negotiations with the UK will continue and she says her opinion is that it's in the interest of both sides to agree a deal. 
#Brexit
Opinion of Boris Johnson’s statement this afternoon on the trade negotiations from well-connected EU diplomat: „
His message was as always mainly domestic.“ „
And he did not say that he did not want to talk any further.“ 
#Brexit
Germany’s ‘Die Zeit’ notes the PM demanded that the EU ‘fundamentally change’ its attitude in trade talks otherwise it’s time to prepare for no deal 
BUT the paper also emphasis Boris Johnson stopped short of walking away from negotiations altogether
EU negotiating team head to London on Monday 👇 https://t.co/jZtClOe1WV
EU negotiating going to London on Monday 👇 https://t.co/jZtClOe1WV
Both sides have now growled at one another. Done a bit of teeth baring. 
Is this the political posturing before difficult compromises are made? 
Again: concessions are needed by BOTH sides for a deal to be reached. 
Let’s see what next week brings..
The PM says EU has been dragging feet so if serious about a deal they can come to U.K. 
That’s exactly what EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday proposed to do: 
Travel to London on Monday to start ‘intense’ ‘sped up’ negotiations ‘even working on the weekend if needed’
PM says to prepare for no deal with EU. 
At their summit EU leaders pushed the Commission to ideas ahead with no deal preparations BUT both sides still talking and that’s the bottom line 
#Brexit
Horse-trading in last stages of negotiations..
Early on it was mused EU might use a deal on financial services for the U.K. (something Brussels decides unilaterally outside current trade talks) to get leverage on fisheries. 
Here the suggestion is a link between fish and energy👇
The Finnish PM has become the second EU leader to leave their summit in Brussels, after a recent contact of hers tested positive for Covid-19. 
Yesterday the European Commission President left the summit after a member of her team tested positive
Last thing EU wants is to add the political, practical and financial headache of no deal with the UK to their current public health and financial crisis provoked by #Covid 
They assume the PM feels the same way but EU believes he needs this trade deal more and so they squeeze.. 
EU diplomats admit they’re trying to put UK under pressure. Are we surprised? 
The PM will no doubt make a tough-sounding statement of his own today. 
In negotiations each side naturally wants to get the maximum possible while giving the minimum away. 
That’s where we are now
Interesting to note that after EU leaders signed off on yesterday’s formal Brexit conclusions, they had a closed-door meeting with no mobile devices allowed. 
Of course they discussed possible compromises EU could make to reach a deal. 
We heard as much from Angela Merkel BUT
Macron is focused on upcoming French presidential elections. His main rival: a nationalist eurosceptic. 
When he insists publicly about maintaining French fishing rights in UK waters because they didn’t choose #Brexit -his aim is to sound nationalist + show leaving EU is costly
EU leaders also play to their domestic gallery. This is the last stage of the trade negotiations. 
We’re poised ahead of the chapter of Big Compromises. 
Neither the U.K. nor the EU want to go first. 
Both want to signal to their home crowd that THEIR interests are being protected
Chief UK negotiator David Frost was quick to react last night - objecting o EU leaders’ tougher-sounding-than-could-have-been formal conclusions to their #Brexit discussion but since when are politicians declarations  taken without a pinch or two of salt?
Coronavirus, CORONAVIRUS, bit of Brexit and some chocolate👇 https://t.co/XLOubF2UNI
European Commission moves to reassure UK it wants to continue INTENSIVE talks - even if adjective was absent from EU leaders written conclusions following their Brexit discussion today. 
Details matter. 
UK chief negotiator David Frost just took to Twitter noting absence of word
EU standing firm in public : says ball now in U.K. court to take moves to make trade deal possible and insisting internal market bill must be changed 👇
Tomorrow it’s over to the PM who said he’ll announce the UK’s next steps
UK’s chief negotiator responds to EU summit conclusions calling on UK « to make the necessary moves to make agreement possible » while calling for ongoing EU-UK talks but not INTENSIVE negotiations 👇
EU leaders conclusions after discussing post #Brexit trade negotiations. 
Note point 5 which puts burden of responsibility on the U.K. to make compromises in order to reach a deal👇EU leaders are more preoccupied with rising #COVID infections than trade negotiations right now..
Sánchez concluded « So we fully support Michel Barnier and hope that in these coming weeks we can achieve this deal that gives certainty and trust in this difficult moment the world is going through with the second wave of Covid. »
« The first is LPF, second is fishing, and the third involves some elements of the commercial links between the UK and EU. 
Obviously for Spain this deal is fundamental – given our historic relationship with the UK as well as our shared commercial and economic interests. »
Spain’s PM Sanchez on #Brexit as he arrived at EU leaders summit: 
« The most important thing is to emphasise our desire for a deal; secondly to maintain unity of the EU27 on our objectives and the thorny issues that still need to be sorted out »
Agreed! 
Macron sounding forthright but considering his is considered the maximalist position in EU when it comes to fishing, he makes no reference here to Brussels’ original demand of pretty much keeping same fishing quotas as when UK was a member state
Merkel on #Brexit as she heads into the EU leaders’ 2 day summit: 
« We want a deal but of course not at any price. 
It has to be a fair deal that both sides can profit from. 
But all efforts are worth it and we will support the negotiations of Michel Barnier + Ursula vonder Leyen »
Macron insisted »I want to be clear: 
this deal will not be made at any price. If these conditions are not met, it’s possible there won’t be a deal. 
We are ready for that. 
France is ready for that. 
We are in the process of finalising. ..
We are ready for a no-deal. »
Macron added «The second issue we need to have fair conditions between the UK and EU to assure us that we have a level playing field on state aid and regulations, especially socially and environmentally. 
Brexit should not create social or environmental ‘dumping’ on our border »
Macron in full #Brexit bad cop mode as he arrived at the EU leaders summit. 
He said : « on no account will our fishermen be sacrificed for Brexit. We didn’t choose Brexit, the British people did. 
So preserving our fishermen’s access to the UK’s waters allows a good compromise»
Worth saying too that summit conclusions will be drafted and redrafted over the two day meeting
France’s Europe Minister talks of one single objective👇: to defend and protect the rights of French fisher people .. 
This, just ahead of todays EU leaders summit where #Brexit trade talks and possible EU compromises are to be explored ..
EU leaders are set to discuss post Brexit trade talks for the first time in months. 
Brussels’ demands from the U.K. are well known. 
What leaders need to debate at their summit now is how far THEY might compromise to get a deal. 
The actual Macron quote on the test and trace app 👇 https://t.co/4FdKruU0Wc
CORRECTION seems he said UK and Germany has better test and trace apps than France. 
He says France was changing its one
President Macron said this evening the UK and German test and trace apps worked better than the French one to date NOT as I first said that the test and trace SYTEMS worked better than the one in France but he added that no country had it right and that France was changing #covid
I did wonder.. 
The perils of live-tweeting. 
Must've half-heard
That must have been it. 
I was live tweeting and so could have half-heard at that point
If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on.”
His exact words on 7 Sept: “There needs to be an agreement with our European friends by the time of the European Council on 15 October if it’s going to be in force by the end of the year. 
So there is no sense in thinking about timelines that go beyond that point
That was the date when the PM said there was no point in talking all autumn and that a deal should be visible by mid October 
“expressed his disappointment that more progress had not been made over the past two weeks. 
The Prime Minister said that he looked forward to hearing the outcome of the European Council (this weeks EU leaders summit)
PM leaves threat of walking away from talks with the EU in the air. 
Following his call this evening with European Commission and European Council Presidents, his spokesman said the PM had noted the desirability of a deal, but
Commentators on French tv France24 saying Macron learned from his mistake from previous lockdown where informed mayors 39mins before public announcement and faced resistance from them. 
Now including them in decision process say commentators #Covid
But admits more needs to be done. Especially to keep people in work he says rather than relying on government economic help
Macron admits that #Covid has hit the most economically vulnerable in France the hardest bc he says they live in small flats, often together with older relatives and often they’re frontline workers. 
He says France has spent more than any other country to help the #Covid affected
Macron says Germany and UK have had better test and test systems than France so far but says no country has got it absolutely right yet #covid
Tester alerter protéger says Macron - France’s strategy for beat the virus : test, warn (those affected so they can quarantine), protect the rest of society. 
Basically test and trace. 
Till now he says the waiting #covid times have been too long
Appeals to them to meet but in fewer numbers. Appeals to the French to be less demonstrative in hugging and kissing wider family members and friends
He’s disseminating info by being questioned by 2 journos. One make, one female. He’s admitting how hard it is for people to lose civil liberties again. 
He’s recognising that the young are paying a huge price on cancelled exams and apprenticeships , curbs on their social life
This is a very different Macron than the ‘high and mighty’ president who declared war in #Covid in a dramatic address to the nation at the start of the pandemic. Tonight instead of decreeing new restrictions from up high, Macron has chosen a very different, humbler style + tone
Macron has announced additional financial support for areas with additional #covid restrictions. 
He also announced fines of between 135 and 1,500 euros for those caught breaking the nighttime curfew to be introduced in Paris and 8 other towns and cities from Saturday
Regarding new #covid restrictions to be introduced in France from Saturday Macron says he trusts in people’s sense of civic responsibility.. but adds that there will be controls
Macron says “we have to keep working, children have to keep going to school but #covid19 levels are “concerning” he says - 
hence introduction of nighttime curfews at least for 4 weeks in Paris île de France and 8 other metropolitan areas including Lyon
Macron declares new state of (health) emergency from Saturday #COVID19
Macron announces night time curfews in 8 metropolitan area from 9pm to 6am for 4 to 6 weeks starting this coming Saturday #COVID19
Possibly more significant than the call this eve between the PM and the European Commission Président about post #Brexit negotiations.. will be the intra EU discussion beginning at this week’s summit about how much to compromise to get a deal with UK 👇
Congrats @TVNaga01 !!!!
PM’s call with European Commission President will take place at 1930 BST. 
The President of the European Council will also be on the call .. ahead of hosting EU leaders for a two day summit starting tomorrow. 
Post #Brexit trade talks are scheduled to be first topic at EU summit
Government takes steps to secure medical supplies for U.K. regardless of outcome of post #Brexit trade talks with the EU 👇
NEW! PM will speak to European Commission Pres Ursula von der Leyen tomorrow afternoon to discuss progress and the lack of it in key areas of trade negotiations. 
This ahead of a summit of EU leaders on Thurs and Friday where the talks will be discussed amongst other issues
The general EU mood is: countries really still want and hope for a deal with the UK but if price is deemed too high or UK walks away then „so be it“. 
t’ll be costly + difficult, the EU Argument now goes, but they say their primary focus is now on a „bigger“ problem: #COVID19 
In the form of publicly berating the EU or threatening Brussels with a UK walkout from negotiations. 
On the latter, diplomats tell me that after previous threats of dying in ditches and a number of missed brexit deadlines, the EU does not take the PM‘s Ultimatums too seriously
EU diplomats also wonder aloud if the PM has ‚something up his sleeve‘ ahead of the summit- either constructive, muse the diplomats, eg a compromise position on the level playing field (in the knowledge that the EU will then compromise on fish) or a „destructive“ move.. 
Nervous diplomats tell me they’re not sure what mood Macron will arrive in to the summit. 
Will he play ball with EU majority or insist on playing ‚Brexit bad cop‘ role, sticking to the maximalist position on fishing for example?
Until the UK government removes clauses from its internal market bill that contradict the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.. 
This is the current EU thinking regarding Brexit and the summit BUT
There are no negotiating rounds planned passed this week but there will be. 
EU diplomats guess the summit will see EU Leaders announcing they want a deal but not at any price; that they will continue negotiating „calmly“ and that they won’t ratify a deal, even if one is agreed
Both sides say they still want a deal and think it entirely possible to reach a deal this year, infact v soon, if only the OTHER side would just be „more realistic“ (ie make the big compromises) 
They have assumed that the UK would be more willing to compromise the longer the process ran, but in fact all these tactics have achieved is to get us to the middle of October with lots of work that could have been done left undone.“
This clearly will not be the case and each side predictably blames the other for that. 
Today a UK government source said: „The EU have been using the old playbook in which they thought running down the clock would work against the UK“
This briefing comes ahead of the EU leaders summit in Brussels end of this week, where Brexit will be discussed most likely I’m told on Friday morning. 
Both Michel Barnier and the PM once described this summit mid October as cut off point by which time a deal had to be agreed
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has briefed Europe Ministers from EU member states that progress continues to be made in negotiations with the UK but not significantly when it comes to key sticking points: level playing field, fish, governance of deal
Before that though the Dutch government is today expected to announce the short term closure of all cafes, restaurants and bars - also a ban on the sale of alcohol in the evening
After Belgium’s health minister warned of possible impending #coronavirus lockdown, RTL Nieuws reports the Netherlands could re-enter what the government called an “intelligent lockdown” if national rate of infection didn’t improve
Europe Ministers from EU countries have just been briefed on state of play in post #Brexit trade negotiations with UK 👇
Hope in Brussels is that a deal is still possible this year BUT big bumps still in the road between now and then
Remember services? 
The dominant sector in UK economy..?? 
Even if there’s a trade deal with EU this year, services have not been prioritised in these negotiations👇
This system does NOT include harmonising coronavirus test and trace systems or the when, why’s or how’s of lockdown rules in EU countries. 
Public health is a national competency (not decided in Brussels). 
EU members still stumbling through dealing with virus nation by nation
Under the scheme, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) will publish a map (to be updated weekly) that categories EU regions (not whole countries) into green, orange and red zones (or grey, for insufficient data)
It’s an attempt by Brussels to avoid unilateral border closures between EU members and the collapse of the Schengen passport free travel area That we saw during the first corona virus wave
EU countries are today expected to formally give the green light (sorry!) to a common #COVID19 traffic light system designed to ease travel across the bloc despite rising numbers of infections
