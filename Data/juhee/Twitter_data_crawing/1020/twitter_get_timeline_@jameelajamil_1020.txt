👍🏽
I’m talking about the shocking number of cases. 
Not the cinemas opening. 
You went in deep with that presumption. 
Just ask next time dude.
It’s on the trans community, not me, or any cis people, to accept an apology and meaningful growth from her, and if they did, so would I.
They are so in love. 
Anyone else only ever cut their fringe/bangs when they’re hormonal and angry and feeling chaotic? 
And then it’s cut badly and you have to keep fixing it until it’s too short and you look like a baby lamb? (Cries in PMS.)
Ahahahaha you’re cute x
No I want the specific moment acknowledged
Well. 
If there was an Emmy for a facial expression 
I’m saying their stans alone are worth stanning! 
I Stan their stans.
Both suits me. 
Iconic is iconic.
Namjoon. ❤️
Can’t decide if I Stan BTS or BTS stans themselves more. 
Their power to disrupt is 💪🏽 ❤️

Yes but it has never felt like enough. And now I know why.
Tom. This is so nice. 
Have you been hacked? 😇
Did not know this was a thing. 
I love America. 
The incel cries in anonymous.
Beach *Boy*. 
Only Mike Love is playing. 
Best rapper in the world right now.
The most depressing thing is watching women expect perfection from themselves and attempt to cancel themselves upon error. 
This is taught to us by our misogynist conditioning
Expecting perfection from a woman is patriarchy. 
Expecting her to go away and shut up upon (innocent) mistakes is patriarchy. 
We allow men to grow and edit and champion them when they do, women must be afforded the same luxury of a capacity for evolution. ❤️
I miss Ted. 
Stupid fucking pandemic. 
🤔
Secret same. 
But I acknowledge it’s hustle.
Goodbye Milky Way old friend. 
You never really developed an identity. 
You were always just the runt to the mighty Mars bar.
He’ll tell you he hasn’t changed since moving from Camberwell to LA but... 
VOTE EARLY FOR FUCK’S SAKE.
This song was premiered by @AnnieMac last week on @BBCR1 and I can’t stop listening. 
What the FUCK?
Chopsdicks
There are some people who tweet me to tell me to shut up. 
Would it not be easier to just mute my name rather than hate-follow? 
I am unable to circulate my own words, it’s not my fault if your friends/favorite publications do. 
Be an adult and just block or mute me for peace.❤️
That’s not it at all. 
Just shows how repulsed people are by age and wrinkles my even referring to them  makes you think 
I’m insulting  someone when actually I’m literally saying it’s so cool 
I wish women were allowed to show ours rather than be airbrushed.
Stop flaunting your clown privilege.
Obsessed.
Nobody was saying there was. 
It’s a viral meme that people  are doing to show “then” and “now” it’s not a joke about oppression. 
You need to think. And then tweet
Always corn flakes.
Pub garden?
So go home from the packed pub at 10pm alone. 
Where is the joke about getting fat? 
Its about being dressed up at fancy events vs living in sweats eating on the floor like teenagers. 
You reached, and you missed.
@Brexit83 Relative suffering doesn’t impact the reality of mass societal stigma.
Whether you’re walking out of your mansion or your council estate flat. 
Stormzy was reported entering his own expensive flat in west London wearing a designer suit...
For the last time...
Did doctors refuse to diagnose you because of your size? 
Did employers not hire you because you looked “unhealthy and lazy”? 
Did you manage to find clothes that fit you in most stores? Is it culturally more acceptable to be thin or fat? 
Are mostly thin or fat people in magazines?
White Privilege isn’t about money, it’s the ABSENCE of RACIAL  discrimination. 
How do people still not understand this? 
Thin privilege doesn’t mean thin people have money, it means they aren’t subjected to constant societal weight based stigma/bullying/harassment.
This means you think wrinkles are bad... I think he looks great and want similar images of women.
He looks great
She was great
Hello! 
If you like my @i_weigh podcast, today you can vote for the @peopleschoice award here: today votes count as twice as much. 😇
😍
Omg 
Also wrinkles are hot. 
Men’s wrinkles are hot. 
This picture is sexier and cooler for how human it looks. 
When will we see a woman’s wrinkles as hot rather than a sign she has “expired.”
Interesting wording. 
Making her sound like the instigator when he is the one who is married and significantly older and putting all the moves on in the pictures and took his wedding ring off. 
And predictably, today she is getting all the shit online because we always blame women.
NBC is going to the Bad Place. 👎🏽
Lol no never- I think it’s hot, I want it to be hot for women too!
I would look to the work of  @yrfatfriend she is an absolute legend and so so informed on the subject.
There is a debate? about body shaming?
The lows we have stooped to when we are bullying an 18 year old pop star about her body, forgetting that not only is she human, but there are children watching our behavior internalizing our words against themselves and others, learning from you how to make this world uglier.

Ladies. 
Every time you find yourself looking in a mirror and despairing of your (great natural) lines, just remember you only notice and hate them because a bunch of men in media decided to never let older women show their natural age on magazine covers and on screen. 
It’s a con.
I really hope when I’m older, if I’m on a magazine cover they keep my wrinkles in the way they do for men. 
Tired of seeing older women being airbrushed to look like emojis, setting up weird and offensive ideals for women who are the same age. 
This is human. 
This is cool. 👇🏽 https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1316363376268922882
I mean...
Story was a fake 💔
Can we name any male comedians singled out for apparently being too fat to play someone without money? 
Do we always single male comedians out for not being thin enough to play someone without money? 
Also just FYI due to genetics/inability to afford nutritious food/work leaving no time to exercise/stress... etc... no money doesn’t always = thin. 🤷🏽‍♀️🤡
Question! 
Why does John Dugdale at @thesundaytimes need to write something so wreckless my callous and fatphobic about @Kathbum and Jessica Barden? 
It’s 2020. 
He’s the man who astoundingly accused the RSC of being “garishly diverse” back in 2018. 
Why pay for his archaic opinion?
😭
Mate I lived on potato smiley faces and bread and had no time between jobs to fit in a work out. 
But mostly why is this even an issue in a comedy review?!
Lol so early
Mood
Enjoying this so much.
