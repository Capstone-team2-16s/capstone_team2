Am confused about the messaging here. 
So is @JoeBiden the senile old man who can't find his way back from the bathroom unaided, or the criminal mastermind of Ernst Blofeld proportions? 
'Aah Mr Trump we were expecting you....'
Lauren, i think you need help....let me put it another way...who needs #Americast when you have pubs...?
Glad you found us....
Lawyers. Lots and lots of lawyers. 
And then maybe the Supreme Court. 
In 2000 I think I’m right in saying 36 days went by post-election before George W was declared the winner
Dear Jock McBritish, Yes, and in same programme I say he's a brilliant politician, with a visceral sense of the mood of the American people, and knows how to tickle it. 
I also say you under-estimate him at your peril. 
But yeah, you go ahead and ignore that
Laaleen....thank you so much. 
Glad you enjoyed! 
I think we might have more to say between now and the election...
Her dressing room is DEFINITELY bigger than mine
Excellent...thanks for writing Stuart
And playing it for laughs. 
Wonder  how that is going to work out in Georgia where the Republicans are facing an unusually tough fight. 
Wonder how much his Dem rival @ossoff is going to raise in 💵 off back of this
Jennie. 
That means a lot - particularly as my son lives there too. 
Tough time to be so far away
Like really soon....
Just emerged from a hot, sweaty edit suite...the latest #Americast with @maitlis and @awzurcher and me
I think the effect of listening back to Biden last night 😉
From this evening #Americast with @maitlis in London and @awzurcher in Washington will  have moving pictures as well as sound. 
Just getting ready to roll in Miami....
I’m sure I have never uttered a word like that...
My diary for today’s Evening Standard
4 big takeouts from @realDonaldTrump #NBCTrumptownhall 
1. can't say whether he was #covid tested on day of first debate
2. seemed to confirm @nytimes reporting on both $750 income tax & $400M debt
3. wouldn't condemn #QAnon
4. didn't mention #HunterBidenEmails at all
Hmm
wear masks - ambivalent
Denounced white supremacy - 48 hours AFTER 1st debate
Transfer of power - refused to say in WH briefing room
pre-existing conditions - yes, but how?
Covid relief bill - nearly scuppered by unilateral announcement to pull plug on talks
I suspect @realDonaldTrump will be furious with the way this is going. 
He's been on defensive with sharp questioning from 
@SavannahGuthrie. 
She has conversational yet tough style of questioning. 
Stand out topics: covid, his personal taxes, QAnon - not where he wants to be
??????????? 
Not an aggressive question, but how does @realDonaldTrump say he's created 160 million jobs? 
Isn't that more or less the entire US workforce? 
Suggests there was virtually 100% unemployment 
#NBCTrumptownhall
'I have heard many different stories on masks,' says @realDonaldTrump 
- every health official advising the WH says where a mask
OMG from @SavannahGuthrie 'you're the president you're not like somebody's crazy uncle' 
#NBCTrumptownhall
@realDonaldTrump says he doesn't know anything about #QAnon and says it is good they are against paedophilia. 
But he says he knows about #antifa
Given salience of this issue, given persistent questions about whether the president got tested on day of  debate, given the questions posed to the WH physician, I'm saying by now we should be able to have a clearer answer than 'possibly I did, possibly I didn't'
Thanks Matt....
Above the @realDonaldTrump boat parade, a light aircraft is towing a Trump/Putin banner!!
That was not a great choice of word. 
Sorry. 
Tremor better?
If I wink once.... 😉 
you know what to do
Bet this has sent a shiver through the @JoeBiden campaign 
About to set sail with boaters and voters for @realDonaldTrump in Miami
As a matter of course @maitlis @awzurcher and I try not to do humility. 
But bloody hell. 
Number 2 in the overall Apple podcast charts for UK?  
Thanks so much guys for all the support/feedback/questions for #Americast
Coming soon.....
They were...!
Leo. He could. 
Think precedent for that is Grover Cleveland, America’s 22nd and 24th président at end of 19th century
Only just seen this, but it  has made me roar with laughter 
Clearly we didn’t spend long enough at #TheVillages - or maybe we did, on second thoughts..... 
From our latest pod....
🧐
🤐🤐🤐🤐🤫🤫🤫🤫🤭🤭🤭🤭
I think this is set to become the improbable soundtrack to #Election2020 
A song that opens with the words ‘young man’ for the 74 and 77 year old candidates (and that’s leaving aside the rest of the lyrics....!)
Am sure the person in the Trump creative team thought this was clever. 
But did anyone stop to think whether it’s smart? 
Old people shd not be punchline to joke. 
They’re essential to the president’s re-election
🙏
He won’t like being compared to low energy Jeb! 
To all the people who say 'but you can't trust the polls,' this is a really interesting read on what is being done to try to get them right in #Election2020
Latest from @maitlis @awzurcher and me on race for Florida- a sunshine state special (try saying that after 4 Margaritas). 
Also a brilliant, brilliant undecided voter
Extra. Extra. Hear all about it. 
Latest from @maitlis @awzurcher and me. 
The title does not refer to either Anthony or me....
Must say hadn’t guessed the Asian bit from his name. 
Must take real courage to be so direct when you’re using a pseudonym
This is an amazing animation of politics and the pandemic in the US, and how nearly all worst affected states are now Republican 
#USElection2020
Cheers Ian.
We do it all the time
@awzurcher will correct me if I’m wrong, but outgoing president plays no constitutional role in proceedings. 
The oath of office is done by Chief Justice. 
Also what if President dies in office, like JFK? 
Ex pres more important for symbolism of peaceful transfer of power
Surprised the poll finding isn’t just under 100%.....
