I think this is good for us as a people!
Class act @TheRealSambora responds to Jon Bon Jovi. 
An amazing THREAD ⬇️ and one that rightly gives credit to @JaniceDean for leading the way on holding  Cuomo accountable for his recklessness. 
How dare he celebrate his “leadership” on COVID?
WORTH YOUR TIME ⬇️⬇️
TGIF people 💕 Thunder 
Biden sounds good/coherent on ABC right now - talking about the country’s future/unity - has the “aw shucks” attitude he sometimes shows.
It’s definitely easier when the moderator lets you speak.
Trying to get excited by this town hall on ABC but confess — I’m struggling. You?
Yes
Seriously? 
Spoken like a man who’s never had a criminal running at him with a deadly weapon.
So far, this is not a town hall for voters, it is designed to appease the angry NBC employees/Dems who are pissed off Trump’s on NBC at all.
More masks! 
How many Q’s can we do on masks?
Wait - they knew they had an audience member asking a mask Q and they still spent 5 mins on masks pre-audience?
Yes! 
Good Q! 
How are you going to get the economy back on track.

Good for Trump for fighting back on this white supremacy Q - the 10,000th one.

Contrast w/MSNBC &amp; its host who made up a fake hacking to excuse her bigoted blog posts re LGBT+.

“Potentially harmful...”
Check out my latest episode with @AlanDersh.  
We covered the backlash he felt supporting Trump during impeachment, I asked him if he thought Jeffrey Epstein killed himself and whether or not he thinks OJ is guilty. 
Tune in to find out:
Insane ppl are attacking @maggieNYT for tweeting out this article, calling her a Trump hack. 
Grow up, Blue Checks. 
Love you too JD. 
You are a force for good in this world.
“Please, please like me” is actually a pretty fun, funny, and self-deprecating way of connecting. 
This is why so many ppl forgive Trump his jagged edges - he can laugh at himself.
