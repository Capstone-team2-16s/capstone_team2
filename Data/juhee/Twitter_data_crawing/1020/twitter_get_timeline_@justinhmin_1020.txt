update: i finished the 24 wings covered in ranch.

 ♥️
are you ever in the middle of a meal but then suddenly have to do something and then you come back but you’re not hungry anymore and you think wow maybe i don’t need to eat 24 buffalo wings covered in ranch to feel satiated?
we’re onto something, kate.
my dream self says sorry.
speechless. happy belated, victoria.
is this how 17-y-olds act?
can’t say i didn’t try.
i was a liar, i gave into the fire, i know i should've fought it, at least i’m being honest.
heard that buying nice workout clothes motivates you to work out.

it doesn’t.
