Anything sour. 
I like sour punch twists, Laffy taffy, peach rings and the sour apple rings.
That’s coming just wait patience my love
I don’t have to wear any makeup
I need ideas 
I need help at lipsyjcnngjgm I dunno how to spell it either 
Halloweentown, beetle juice, hocus pocus, silence of the lambs 
Sunny side up I got egg on my face
I die for it 
The jealous kind: https://t.co/CV84g7bAVq

The jealous kind
Baby I’m jealous of the girls with lighter eyes 
Baby I’m jealous of the witches that you likeee 
Hahaa
