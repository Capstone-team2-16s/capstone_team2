Trump has risen the bar on lowering the bar. 
I love those two so much.
This is directly from the good work of @RobertBilott and his tireless search for the truth about #PFAS and Forever Chemicals.

They have shaped every single political conversation we are having and have already changed the world for the better. 
Lift them, honor them and admire them for pulling the sleep from our eyes and making us more human. 
They are the change we‚Äôve waited for. 
There has never been a generation more aware, more active and more powerful. 
They are clear, bright commuted and inspired. 
They are literally fighting for our lives.
Condolences to Cecil‚Äôs family and friends. 
He was a great advocate for the environment and a beautiful warrior and teacher for the whole movement about environmental racism. 
Another brutal loss in a year of difficult losses. 
Be kind and loving to each other, family. 
RIP Hero.

Put #CrazyUncleTrump and #CrazyUncleRudy back on the couch watching Fox News all day, all by themselves, again.
Don‚Äôt worry about it. 
Not only will you be fine but you just elongated your career by telling the truth and standing up for the oppressed.
Will you please stop posting national polls? 
With the electoral college such as it is they are absolutely misleading because the election isn‚Äôt decided by populate vote. 
They hold no real value to the nation. 
They do not reflect our electoral process honestly.

Hello @BenSasse do you stand by your words in the cold light of day? 
Or are you ‚Äúwalking back‚Äù and equivocating today. 
Know where you stand and stand there, man.
We all have one. 
No one in the family likes him, they avoid him like a #SuperSpreader and they have blocked his social media rants.

You did loose the Lincoln project people and the Never Trumpers, and a lot of the Vets you pissed off by calling them losers, you lost Lindsay Graham then you got him back. 
You did loose Ben Sasse but that‚Äôs just because he thought no one was listening. 
He will be back tomorrow.
To be fair Hollywood Elites James Woods and Clint Eastwood are for you. 
And Silicon Valley Elite Peter Thiel is for you. 
Convicted felons Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn and Trump‚Äôs old friend and dance partner Jeffrey Epstein as well as the Taliban, Nazis and the KKK.
The whole of the natural world is against you. 
Putin is for you and Steve Bannon is for you. 
Dictators and despots are also for you. 
Flies are for you. 
The Taliban and the KKK are for you and so are nazis and white supremacists. 
The Tic Tok kids are against you though.
