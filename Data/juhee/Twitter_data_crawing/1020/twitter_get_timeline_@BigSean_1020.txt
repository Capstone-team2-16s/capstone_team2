It’s chilling on my plate cause 
I don’t eat that shit lol.
For sure 🤟🏾🌍💙🙏🏾
You only as complete as your plan ☝🏾
I been on them everyday about this. 
They are the slowest ever. 
It’s being made and sent out this week and next and some of the more detailed shirts and items at the end of the month. 
Took way longer than expected n they blamed it on Covid affecting the factory production. 
Love!
OTW
N holding grudges only hurt yourself. 
Sooner or later, they get what they deserve and you get what you deserve. 
Facts 🤟🏾
Yup!
It’s gonna come a time where you see who wit you and who REALLY wit you... big difference!
It’s shipping this week and next week! 
I just got a update. 
Some of the more detailed pieces ship closer to the end of the month. 
I been on them everyday making sure it gets out. 
They talking bout COVID slowed down production time so it’s taking longer than it should on their end
Yeah, all love. 
It’s taking too long but I just got a report today and most of it is shipping out this week, and next week. 
Some pieces took longer to make too
It’s pissing me off that it’s not all sent out yet. 
Since they pressed them up fresh it takes longer. 
they are telling me because of COVID their staff is short taking longer @ factories. 
Shit irritating as fuck, working on getting out ASAP. 
Love n thanks for ya patience!
Do that 🤞🏾
It’s pissing me off too, I been on them every couple hours doing the best I can. 
It’s getting to you soon as humanly possible. 
Thank you
