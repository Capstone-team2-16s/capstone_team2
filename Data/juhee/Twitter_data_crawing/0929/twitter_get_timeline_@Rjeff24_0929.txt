It’s crazy! The Miami Heat are what we thought the Clippers would be. Gritty, well coached, deep and balanced attack... they are a problem! They’ve taken down Celtics and Milwaukee and only lost 3 games this postseason 🤯😱 

Lakers vs Heat in FINALS...LIKE IVE BEEN SAYING  Y’all better start listening 😏
Nuggets in 9
Lakers are undefeated when entering the 4th Quarter with a lead! ....52-0 😑😳
Me : I feel like the Nuggets are ok! What do you think?
