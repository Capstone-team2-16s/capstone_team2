If I have an early call time, I cannot sleep until 15 minutes before said call time. Because my insomniac, hyper pressured mind is my enemy. My eyes are going to look as though they had been replaced by actual bollocks.

Thinking you can walk into @Sephora for 1 thing... and that you will leave with 1 thing. 

The question is, will the algorithms even send this information to Trump supporters? #socialdilemma

I love him. 

I’m shooting my dream campaign tomorrow. Little south Asian me never thought I’d see it. ❤️ 

Here I am playing Frolf. Frisby golf. Do I apply for the Olympics now? Or...? 

Jesus. 

My new obsession.

Omg. This thread. @hatttiegladwell 

I used to be a massive prick on here when I was younger, angrier and more mentally unstable. Made me feel powerful and in control for about 3 seconds. I get it. Nothing says “help me” more than going out of your way to troll a stranger. 

Playing frolf. Frisby golf. It is a hilarious game. Highly recommend.
Happy weekend. 

Imagine spending your Saturday looking for a photo from almost 3 years ago to try and drag someone for clicks. 😂 

Hey, any of you know any fabulous fat pole dancers? Don’t have to be professionals, can just be great. Can you tag them/yourself below? (This is for a music video) I will block and report any unkind/fatphobic messages.)

This, as well as so many great interview with amazing voices/activists are now live on my personal YouTube channel.YouTube/jameelajamil. Come join us as we learn from the best. ❤️ 


I completely hear the exhaustion and frustration over voting for those who felt ignored and unprotected under the democrats previously. But PLEASE read this important thread about what happens if you don’t use your voice and opportunity to fight for your rights this November. ❤️

I love how much dogs love.

So silly. 

“Britain is not a racist country.” 

Throw in a mini fridge and this is *exactly* how I would decorate a home if James wasn’t here. 

Wow 

Hilarious. 

This is a yes or no question surely. 

I am speaking in congress on Tuesday regarding prevention of weight discrimination in schools. I am nervous.

While It’s frustrating to just have people write wild shit about you, spread misinformation and hate...all the time, and twist everything you do/say and not be able to fight back, I get why it’s problematic for me to do it on this easily spreadable and increasingly toxic site. 

Wait... what? 🤯

He destroys all of my stuff but I love him. 

Most beautiful song about mental health that I have maybe ever heard. From the perspective of the person who loves someone struggling. Means the world to me. By @khushimusic 

Best thing I’ve seen in ages. 

Omg!!!!!

I threaten the tabloid media because it exists on advertising, mostly from products to make women more “attractive.” They prey on the very insecurities I work to dismantle and so I’m making their jobs harder so they’re doubling down on me, and I don’t give a fuck. I’m staying.

I’m so proud of what we are doing with I Weigh on my YouTube channel!!! The mini series’ we are handing over to other activists/social commentators are SO good. Their voices and perspectives are brilliant. This series is especially lols. 

So, so horrifying.
