Yes. And off record, EU national diplomats often say this isn’t a big issue for EU but state aid (the other issue affected by Internal Market Bill) is huge for them. Could be tactics -Keep something up sleeve that’s easy to compromise over to bargain for another thing you want??

Michael Gove says U.K. and EU are willing to use “every second every minute every hour” to reach agreement on implementing the Withdrawal Agreement BUT EU says it’s seen no sign from government they will remove parts of internal market bill that override that co-signed agreement

PM’s spokesperson says while this week is the final formal round of EU-UK trade negotiations, he expects discussions to continue up to the EU leaders’s summit on 15 October. He described atmosphere in talks as relatively positive – but that ‘much was to be done’..EU in agreement

EU Commission Vice Pres says “We are determined to do our utmost to get a deal on a Future partnership (with the U.K.) and on implementing the Withdrawal Agreement but a lot depends on what UK brings to the table”

“A lot if these decisions are politically sensitive but technical in nature (eg IT systems, VAT regime) so we will need to speed up frequency of meetings” says EU Commission Pres Sefcovic regarding meetings of the EU-UK committees for implementing Withdrawal Agreement 

“It’ll never be the EU who walks out on the negotiations” says EU Commission Vice Pres Sefcovic of the EU/UK trade talks #Brexit
EU says Brussels and UK still far apart on issue of whether businesses need to fill out exit declarations for goods leaving Northern Ireland
Maros Sefcovic EU Commission Vice President says got no indication today from Michael Gove that gov is planning to remove “contentious” parts of internal market bill. That’s why he said the EU was looking at “all means available” to take legal action #Brexit 

EU Commission Vice Pres Sefcovic met Michael Gove in Brussels today in 3rd meeting of Joint Committee designed to oversee implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement aka Divorce Deal -huge EU concern has been the Internal Market Bill 

Huge #Brexit week starts today:It’s the last scheduled round of EU-UK negotiations to work out trade + other future relations eg police cooperation, security. Today there’s an EU-UK meeting to discuss Internal Market Bill and if Downing Street intends to break the Divorce Deal 

Know you e heard it before but it really is crunch time this week in post #Brexit negotiations w the EU. MEPs warning that the flow of medicine is endangered if no deal.. in the middle of a pandemic👇

Switzerland has voted to keep EU’s freedom of movement rules. Switzerland is not an EU member and polls suggest majority prefer to retain sovereignty over laws and borders BUT most voters opted today to keep ties with EU (economic benefits)👇 

Keep an eye on Switzerland today.. Holding a referendum to end free movement - a key part of its relationship with the EU. Many see lessons for UK’s post #Brexit relationship with Brussels here. If the Swiss vote Yes today.. 

Yes👇EU leaders unlikely to engage till hear from Barnier there’s movement from UK. Even then there’ll likely be quite some to and fro. If/when deal almost there, it’s thought PM might meet EU Commission Pres before sign off of deal at General Affairs Council (not leaders summit) 

Bluster and posturing aside, how close are we to an EU-UK post #Brexit trade deal? My thoughts from Brussels ahead of next week‘s formal negotiating round👇 

Honoured! Thank you. 

Reaction in Brussels to this article 👇 is that either A) Downing Street is sending a message via journalist that it is now willing to make compromises - thereby immediately making a deal more likely (as Eu already said it‘s willing to compromise) OR ..

EU response to this👇is that « preparedness » will certainly be brought up at the Joint Committee meeting with Michael Gove on Monday. Brussels says he has given EU his word that the Protocol will be implemented so EU taking his word for it ..

This week’s EU leaders summit now delayed as the host - European Council Pres Charles Michel - has gone into quarantine. This, after a security officer with whom he was  “in close contact early last week” tested positive for Covid 19 

« The EU will not be renegotiating » 👇says bloc’s chief representative on the Joint Committee (JC) -the body created to oversee implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement - ahead of meeting his UK equivalent, Michael Gove next week
