Hang on. This is problematic. 
Last night: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs totally fake news. Made up. Fake.‚Äù
Today: ‚Äúillegally obtained information‚Äù
Which is it?

This is why the @nytimes #DonaldTrumpTaxes story might well resonate - it is not some call with a Ukrainian leader about military aid  and investigations into an obscure gas company. This is very easy to understand to anyone who pays income tax in the US

But will it make a difference....? 

But of course... #2020worstyear 

Incredible @nytimes story. The year @realDonaldTrump became president and was listed as a billionaire by Forbes he paid just $750 in income tax. And killer line from report: ‚ÄòTrump has been more successful playing a business mogul than being one in real life‚Äô

My report tonight on #SCOTUS - Joe Biden says Supreme Court nomination is a ‚Äúthreat to democracy‚Äù - BBC


This is amazing. Well worth finding the time for. Blood Lands is bloody fantastic 


This really does boggle the mind: that in the midst of a deadly pandemic, protestors are clashing with police - over the pandemic - resulting in injuries on both sides

Sorry. Still gives me shivers..... 

Good summary, if you want a quick digest of where #AmyConeyBarrett stands on the big issues
#SCOTUS 

The 'compare and contrast' quotes from Lindsey Graham really are quite something


So awful and so shocking. And thank goodness it is so shocking. Sadly here in the US, police being shot - or police shooting suspects - is an everyday occurrence.


Looking forward to it (he smiles nervously...) 

So not from Queens, New York then? ü§î 

Ouch. 

I think latest @foxnewsalert polls are not going to go down well at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 

Great work from Donie at CNN  what price facts? what price truth? 

You probably know this, but our latest pod is up. Would love to hear your views on the two congressional candidates @maitlis and I interview - one Republican, one Democrat. Also latest on #RBG 

A reminder from a different time and a different century.

He won‚Äôt have liked this - not one little bit. #RBG 

No wonder @realDonaldTrump wants to get ride of this FBI Director as well...he just doesn‚Äôt get the narrative. 

Whoa. Just now from @realDonaldTrump on #MeghanMarkle -  "I'm not a fan of hers, and  would say this....I wish a lot of luck to Harry, because he's gonna need it.‚Äù

I do hope we didn‚Äôt swear.

Sorry, but isn‚Äôt it a bit Dad‚Äôs Army to have to stop and do your shoe laces up? Wonder whether he‚Äôs Private Pike. 

It‚Äôs tightening.

But not a whole lot of social distancing. 

Oh @maitlis - that is joyous! Thank the lord he wasn‚Äôt in Kent 
This is where it is deeply uncomfortable: Total US deaths = 200k. Global deaths =965k. US deaths represent 20%. plus plus of total US share of world population = 4%. Therefore 5x more deaths relative to pop'n. How is that an A+?
