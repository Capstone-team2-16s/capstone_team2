Tonight. We premiere. On Showtime. #TheComeyRule 

The Texas Tech coaching staff from the 2pt conversion thru overtime have left me scratching my head...for eternity. Those poor players. And I’m not even a fan of the team. Poor fellas.

Hey @RatchedNetflix, give Bernard Herrmann his props. Dude’s a genius. Looking for him in the credits. 😊 #CapeFear  #RatchedNetflix
Finally starting Ratched and I can’t help be but transported to the brilliance of both Scorcese’s and the original CAPE FEAR thanks to the inimitable music of the great Bernard Herrmann. Can’t hear that music without thinking that boat sequence and my man DeNiro. #RatchedNetflix 

So cool. I’ve had the pleasure of working for both these fine gents. This is amazing. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 to the legendary and talented @VirgilWilliams and @BillyRay5229. 

That’s some high praise right there. We premiere Sunday. Tune in. #TheComeyRule 

Enough. Said. 

We air Sunday and Monday 

Look at this mess. 

Vote. In. Person. And even after then...pray. 

We need more of THIS Fauci. Play to win the game. 

Ridiculous 

Ridiculous 

What the hell.

🙏

I cannot agree with this more. Fabulous actress. Ease.

No offense to any talented artist/winner, but Shira Haas deserved to win that Emmy last night. Her performance in Unorthodox was truly incredible. 

HOW ‘BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!! #EpicComeback #Cowboys 

This.

Good read. Keep hope alive.

Timely. Right after that lovely earthquake too. 

Earthquake. Nice good one. What a day.
This is a great and sobering thread, with a call to arms. 

Absolutely. And may many more choose the side of GOOD vs. evil.

This is a beautiful summoning of courage to dig deeper.

Yes

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Damn. 2020 continues to claim some true warriors for justice. Salute. Damn. 🙏 #NotoriousRBG #Vote

But...out of curiosity, if “we’ve done more for Puerto Rico than anybody”, didn’t Puerto Rico deserve this kind of response THREE YEARS AGO. It’s been three years. I mean, I know you’ve got to  win Florida but come on. That’s cold.

Damn I love football. 

This was so kind. It always touches me how supportive fans can be. And when you unexpectedly get kicked to the curb from a project, it’s unsettling, so people’s generosity and enthusiasm for your work mean the world. The appreciation is not lost on me. Back at you all. Always🙏

Honored to be a part. Watch us Sept. 27 and 28. The sequels are playing out right before our very eyes. 

Yes.👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 


On a side note from all the world’s obvious madness, one thing is surprisingly sure for me... @CobraKaiSeries is everything. The sentimental 80’s kid and perennial nerd in me are waxing on and off giddily on Cloud 9 🙏#CobraKai #CobraKaiOnNetflix

Heart busted wide open. Wow.

Smdh 

Love it 

Stanley Crouch. Wow. Rest In Peace. 🙏
That is extraordinary grace and restraint to leave this woman alone after this. Wow. 🙏
