I think pretty much all of us have. Except for Trump who has grifted his way through life. I wonder what all the people who kept saying, "He is a great business man and that's why he would be a great president!", will say now? 

Love this guy. If you were at Standing Rock or touched by it please know Kevin Killer is running for Oglala Sioux Tribe President.

.@LindseyGrahamSC it‚Äôs not that we hate your guts. It‚Äôs that we love justice, fairness, and morality. Somewhere along the line you left those things behind. It‚Äôs sad but the truth is we are better without you and South Carolina needs some new blood, not an entrenched career guy. 

Pennsylvania friends: be aware that PA uses a two-envelope mail ballot system: A completed ballot goes into a ‚Äúsecrecy envelope‚Äù that has no identifying information, and then into a larger mailing envelope that the voter signs. 1/2 

We must center communities of color in our climate action; they are who are most affected by the Climate Crisis.¬†s well as who are already creating solutions! 

And it only took 4 f-ing years. 

Biden Buries Trump on Jobs, Covid response and unifying our country. #VoteReady

Okay...so what‚Äôs the plan? The man has told us he won‚Äôt leave peacefully, he is stacking the court with Justices he knows will rule in his favor, and he is talking about tossing ballots. What is the plan?

Grateful for NH‚Äôs #PFAS champions @RepChrisPappas @RepAnnieKuster, who get a 100% score on @EWG‚Äôs toxic chemicals scorecard 

People will tell exactly who they are and what they are up to if you listen. Our President is saying he is stacking the court so he can win. He is saying the judges he is choosing will onsite he wins. It f-d up.

This story is too common. I admire Bob for coming out as a survivor. I admire AG Shapiro for going after these predators. There is a lot more work to do. 

Our democracy can't withstand this Senate or President any longer.
