Listening to the test press of vinyl of #superbloom. My heart is racing and I have one million feelings about what this album really means to me. I’m so ready to show you some of the most personal and real songs I’ve ever written. 

Hey skinny skinny. Don’t you think about the future. Hey skinny skinny too bad. Hey skinny skinny. Stop your thinking bout tomorrow. You’ll never make it like that.
(Too bad)

The Skinny Skinny MV faces + fights back against the demon that lives in the mirror. I wanted to capture the struggle of not feeling at home in your own body. A video of battle, footage of the fight, a snapshot of resilience. I hope you find it empowering.

Skinny Skinny video out tonight at 9pm PT.
