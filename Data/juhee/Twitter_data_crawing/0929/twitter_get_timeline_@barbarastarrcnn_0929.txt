It’s been 80 days since DoD leaders promised to release an investigation ‘within days’ into an Army helicopter buzzing protesters  

Right now, as a military team brings the casket of #JusticeRuthBaderGinsburg up the steps of the US Capitol, perhaps no greater reminder that US troops swear as oath to the Constitution and only to that North Star rule of law. 

General Mark Milley, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff "We know factually that masks work."
Gen Mark Milley: ”We are right now in the midst of a general election and each of you have earned your right to vote. So I would strongly encourage that everyone exercise their right vote when the time comes and use the rights that have been granted to you in the Constitution." 

Pentagon leadership remains adamant at staying out of partisan election politics and declaring the Constitution its North Star. But the questions have not stopped. 

"Let us not hedge about one thing," @bartongellman writes. "Donald Trump may win or lose, but he will never concede." Who will stop him from throwing the election into chaos? 

Most Americans would have no reason to know Gen Selva’s name. But inside the very highest ranks he   is very respected.

Several DOD officials tell me Pentagon and Gen Milley continue to monitor the situation in Louisville as we learn of grand jury decision in the investigation into the killing of Breonna Taylor. DOD goal: ensure civilian/state resources used & no need for active duty they say.
