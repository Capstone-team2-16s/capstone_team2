More great news on another vaccine. 
There‚Äôs real reason for hope, because, you know, #SCIENCE!!!
I hope you liked the rest of the film. üòÉ
#HumanNatureFilm 
If you don‚Äôt lead, you must concede.
Sharing this for others to weigh in on suitability of #HumanNatureFilm for children. 
Thanks.
No matter how many launches you have seen, it is still a step into awe and wonder to see humans leave the gravitational bonds of Earth. 
Congratulations to all on a successful launch. 
#Science
Thank you. 
This means a lot. 
Netflix. Thanks.
When I see video of the ‚ÄúProud Boys‚Äù and others of their ilk, I think these ain‚Äôt the kind of folks who put a person on the moon. 
But maybe they think that‚Äôs a hoax too.
That means a lot. 
We set out trying to make not just a science show, but a true film.
Wow. Thanks. 
I concur with all of this, especially the Oscar part üòÄ. 
#DareToDream? 
Thank you very much for the kind words @JoyAnnReid
Thank you. 
#Science Indeed!
It's available on Crave. 
Hopefully coming to Netflix in Canada later.
Thank you very much. 
I'm glad you liked #HumanNatureFilm enough to recommend it. 
That's always the standard one hopes to achieve.
I am honored. 
Thank you.
And if a frog had side pockets, he‚Äôd carry a handgun. 
A tale of two realities. 
(One being adherence to actual reality, and science, and leadership, etc.)

Please Direct Message @AlgonquinBooks to claim your autographed copy of #WhatUnitesUs.  
Thank you all for joining us on this journey. 
More exciting promotions to come.
Frankly, my trolls, I don‚Äôt give a damn.
AMERICA. WAKE UP. 
NOW!!!! With COVID, we know what¬†works. 
Wear masks. Social¬†distance. Wash hands. 
A vaccine is coming. 
But you can't vaccinate dead people or those suffering long term effects. 
I want to gather for the holidays. 
But I want my fellow Americans to live more.
Hope you enjoy it. 
We‚Äôre very interested in what young viewers think of #HumanNatureFilm
Your story was a powerful moment in our #HumanNatureFilm, thank you for letting us share it.
Thank you. 
That was our doc. 
#HumanNatureFilm was on NOVA and now is also on Netflix. 
We‚Äôre very proud of it and are pleased so many are enjoying it. 
We need more #science documentaries that have faith in the interests and intelligence of a general audience.

This strikes me as a bad idea, a dangerous idea. 
It‚Äôs also exactly the wrong message to send to America as the pandemic spikes.
A must read! 
There's a limit to what even heroes can accomplish. 
‚ÄúThe most precious resource the U.S. health-care system has in the struggle against COVID-19 isn‚Äôt some miracle drug. 
It‚Äôs the expertise of its health-care workers‚Äîand they are exhausted.‚Äù

Please tell your Dad Semper Fi for me. (One time short time Marine private)
We look back in horror and disbelief at ancient approaches to medicine. 
Bleeding? Leeches? 
In the future people will look back at us. 
Not wearing a mask? Seriously? 
The difference is we should know better. Lunacy.
Is it too early to shamelessly self-promote #WhatUnitesUs as the PERFECT holidayüéÅ - for friends and family alike? 
Asking for a friend. 
(Okay... asking for me. 
But hey it‚Äôs my Twitter. 
It's allowed, right? üòÄ)

#HumanNatureFilm
COVID is sadness. 
Profound sadness. 
It is suffering, and sacrifice. 
It is perhaps the greatest abdication of presidential responsibility in American history.
I have seen a lot of death and tragedy in my lifetime. 
But this shakes me to the core, completely and irrevocably.
Donald Trump is the Washington Generals of election lawsuits
I am thankful for all of you are are reading WHAT UNITES US. 
Some of you mentioned you shared with friends and family across the political spectrum. 
I am very curious to hear any response on that front. 
#WhatUnitesUs
Trust me, there is a lot that falls into the "can't do" category.
Yes. It is the same film.
Thank you for your support. 
Would love to hear how the reading and viewing goes. 
Take care.
For those looking to watch HUMAN NATURE, it's available currently on Netflix.
We're eager to hear your feedback on HUMAN NATURE. 
We wanted to make a documentary about science that embraced the nuance and elegance of the #CRISPR breakthrough, and allowed viewers to grapple with the complicated moral questions. 
Thanks for your interest. 
#HumanNatureFilm
A big happy birthday to a wonderful neighbor and Austin institution.

Thanks for watching #HumanNatureFilm. 
We are very proud of our documentary. 
#CRISPR might end up being one of the biggest stories I will have covered.
Joe Biden won, Donald Trump lost. 
That is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.
On this #VeteransDay we honor those who served in our armed¬†forces. 
We recognize the perilous moment in which we find ourselves, and pray the example of shared sacrifice by those who have worn the uniform of this great nation can bring us greater unity and sense of community.
May you read it in health. 
Thank you for your support.

Stay tuned or follow @AlgonquinBooks for details.
With about 150 million votes, and Republicans desperate for even the most skimpy of fig leafs to their rhetoric of fraud, it‚Äôs truly stunning that despite all the sound and fury what they‚Äôve  found is, essentially, signifying... nothing.
COVID didn‚Äôt disappear on Nov. 4. 
Instead, it is spiking. 
It is dangerous. 
It is widespread. 
And it is infectious. 
There is hope of a vaccine but a chasm of death and suffering remains. 
Stay steady. Stay maksed. And stay distanced.
I love giving away these books @AlgonquinBooks. 
It's Day 2 of the contest. 
If you want a chance to win a signed hardcover of #WhatUnitesUs, all you have to do is retweet this, or the tweet from my supportive publisher below.

In my @RadioAndySXM broadcast, I want to hear from you -all points of view are welcome.¬†
Now that Joe Biden has been declared the winner of the presidential election, how can we unite as a country and move forward? 
Dial 844-305-2639 at 10:15am ET and let's talk #DanRathersAmerica
Chilling and a challenge to the coverage by many in the press who may fail to fully convey the stakes and dangerous outrages.
