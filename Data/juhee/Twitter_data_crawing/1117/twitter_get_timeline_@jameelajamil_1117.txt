If anyone can handle a disaster, it’s New Yorkers but I still hate that they are so consistently tested. 
A bloody tornado... is... too much. 
2020 is drunk and needs some fucking water. 
I love you NYC.

The media expect a 23 year old Black man to do the job of feeding Britain rather than holding the ACTUAL GOVERNMENT accountable, whose job it is... ps.

But we don’t care about votes....
I’M BANKSY!
I WON AN OSCAR!

Is there a new competition happening?
Guess who “discovered” America and raped and murdered its actual inhabitants? 
Where do you think these fucked ideologies and hypocrisies come from?
Save our NHS, get these fucking caviar guzzling, elitist, xenophobic monsters out of office. 
The fact that both she and myself are descendants of immigrants...and this is the hill she’s dying on? 
Imagine being offered a chance to live in a wonderful country and then building a career and power here, and then using your privilege to close the doors behind you. 😶
Horrifying. 
This bill is delivering on the fear mongering of the right wing media and government that infused SOME of the people of our country with xenophobia and misplaced anger. 
Scapegoating immigrants, the very people who saved all our lives this year. 🤢
Wonder if Don Don will speak about this at any point or if he only needed Florida for votes and now doesn’t give a fuck even though he’s still currently in power?
I’m clinically weak.
Ridiculous beauty and brains
I’ve watched her speak on stage so many times before and I could watch her speak forever, no notes, no teleprompter, she’s just fluent in brilliance, integrity and passion.
