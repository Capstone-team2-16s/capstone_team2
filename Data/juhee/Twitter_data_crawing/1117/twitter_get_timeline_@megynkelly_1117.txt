From the one &amp; only Coleman Hughes (@coldxman):
“You don’t have to teach patriotism. 
All you have to teach is balanced world history. 
And a rational person will come to the conclusion that there is something special about America.”
Happy Autumn, the greatest season of the year. 
Unity! Healing! 
Everywhere u get podcasts!
This one is personal, &amp; highlights my friend @JaniceDean’s crusade for truth when it comes to Covid &amp; Cuomo. 
Also what she said when once asked “so, how are you at phone sex?” 
(Her answer will make you lol.)
And you say you want “unity.” 
The madness. ;)
The great @mtaibbi - one of the most talented writers &amp; journalists in America - with a brutally honest, unsparing assessment of the media, the far Left wokesters, and the “dumbest book ever written” White Fragility. 
Enjoy!
od bless our veterans and the USA! 
Courage, sacrifice, dignity — thank you for setting an example to which we should all aspire. 
With gratitude...
Me: “So many things are controlled by the L: sports, publishing, the media,Hollywood. 
What do conservatives control?”.
@DennisPrager: “Ourselves. 
We don’t want to control other ppl. 
We want to be left alone to lead a life we think is important.” ⬇️ 
It really was a powerful emotional journey - gonna be thinking about it for a long time. 
Proud to know you @JaniceDean. 💕
Honestly, not ONE MORE DAMN LECTURE, AD, OR ABSURD MORAL PREENING from this absolutely depraved group or anyone who supports them - on anything, ever.
I recommend you not take her up on that Sir.
Omg
First @RichardGrenell gets erased and now @KellyannePolls? 
Classy. 
Breaking!!! 
Oh! Tough guy!! 
How about you do an interview w/⁦@JaniceDean⁩ to prove it? 
She’s so sweet - even wrote a book called “Mostly Sunny” - what’s there to fear?
@bpmehlman w/a great synopsis of why voters behaved as they did in all races (federal, state)... 
Biden had no coattails, narrowest mandate...
Trump seriously hurt by his handling of COVID.
Wherein the attempted fact-check on Tucker fails:
“The Fox host...darkly hinted that Democrats & the press were making enemies lists.” 
Kid, they literally are making enemy lists:

This is crazy. 
He helped Biden draft his speech on Sat night, without disclosing that fact to the audience (or anyone?), then reacted to the speech live on the air as a paid MSNBC contributor. 
Let me guess- he liked it?
No one is talking to you.
This is amazing! 
Congrats!
Can you imagine if we did this to Obama’s “If you like your plan you can keep your plan”??  
I am not in favor of cutting the WH press sec off or the prez off to prevent misleading. 
Fact check after the statement, yes. 
But it’s not our job to protect the viewers’ virgin ears.
Hi @jkbjournalist - think you meant to address that to @KirstenPowers. 
Have a great day!
Pro-reason

Always promising to be better and then ... not.

He’ll take you right off the cliff!
