Will the commander in chief call their families? 
Will anyone in a civilian position of authority write a letter of condolence? 
Note new acting secretary of defense told troops in a late night memo he is their “leader”. 
not tweets or statements. 
Any actual reach out?
Wait. I thought it was about credible deterrence not about the Air Force being scary...more precisely “bomber trifecta scary”?
Hollyanne Milley, cardiac care nurse, is how its done. 
#FirstResponders actually do rock!

Btw the meeting was with the Lithuanian Defense Minister who graciously offered his condolences on the death of servicemembers in Sinai yesterday something we have yet to see from @realDonaldTrump I believe. 🇱🇹
The Pentagon press corps like press across the globe remains on the job. We are ...not...leaving...ever...
DOD press corps asked Acting SecDef Miller, Afghanistan troop withdrawal & adherence to Constitution at his first bilateral meeting. 
He didnt acknowledge questions and three members of press staff stepped in front of us blocking the way. 
That's their choice of course..but......
Tonight hours later no words of condolence from the commander in chief 
Gators on golf courses (in Florida of course!) are back!

#GenMilley Saddened by the loss our US service members. 
We stand in solidarity with our French and Czech partners as we all face the loss of our troops today in the Sinai Peninsula. 
Now in: Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller: 
“The Defense Department is deeply saddened by the loss of six U.S. and two partner nation service members in a helicopter crash in the Sinai Peninsula operating with the United Nations Multinational Force and Observers (MFO)."
And condolences to the French and Czech citizens who also lost their lives.
US military fatalities just increased by one in Sinai helo crash  today. 
Now 6 US servicemembers killed. 
Fact: not one word from  Pentagon, State or WH.  
Six Americans died today in service of the Constitution, the country and peace. 
May their memories be a blessing.
Turn up your speakers and listen to the sound of peace breaking out.

"I would prefer to leave like my predecessors in previous administrations left, everyone wants the dignified exit but if it's not to be it's not to be, I walk away holding my head high knowing I did the best I could, I put the country first,” Esper in Nov 4 interview w/CNN.
General Mark Milley,JCS chrm, held "tank" meeting with joint chiefs and combatant commanders around the world in the wake of Esper being fired, a senior US military official said.  
Mil officials will now call counterparts to assure them the US military maintains its stability.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows called Mark Esper just before President Trump tweeted that Esper had been “terminated”, according to a US defense official.
