People get used to crossing that line wit you like like it’s normal, then get to begging n pleading when they gotta face the repercussions like every cause ain’t got a effect!
But it’s not that easy huh
It’s not
Quickest cure for anxiety is to live in the moment...
Thank you bro! 
Long as people feel it then we already won! 
But dat would be fire too 🙏🏾💙🏁🤞🏾
That’s not true, it’s been a lot of orders delivered. 
but the real deal is that I been on them and checking everyday n they went through a Covid cutback n had to cut back production. 
It’s not me personally doing so I’m on them as much as possible to get them out ASAP. Love
It’s on the way guys! 
Production took a L with Covid, but the merch is quality and will be worth the wait I promise! 
This delay in delivery won’t happen again! Love
🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s like part 2! 
Same producer, that was my goal to give it that texture 🤟🏾🔥🌍💪🏾🌹
