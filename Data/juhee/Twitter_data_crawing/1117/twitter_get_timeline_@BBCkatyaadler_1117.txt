Agreed. Loved it!
Trade talks have started again in Brussels with the UK. 
EU chief negotiator says bloc remains ‘determined, patient, respectful‘ .. 
Gaps on fish, competition and governance need to be bridged + compromises made this week/next. 
Transition period finishes end of next month #Brexit
Austria joins the list of European countries considered to have ‘handled’ #covid19 well in the first wave. No longer. 
“Hard lockdown” is now being re-introduced incl closing schools  http://kurier.at
Interesting thought 👇 https://t.co/va4OJvC4al
UK chief negotiator arrives in Brussels. 
Both sides sounding *firm* ahead of resuming talks BUT don’t dismiss threat of no deal as political posturing .. 
If signif compromise not forthcoming -by UK on LPF and EU on fish (+these aren’t the only compromises needed) then forget deal
George Eustice says on Marr that deal still possible with EU but EU needs to revise its mandate. 
Chief negotiators Frost and Barnier meeting later today. 
If we’re still at the  stage of each side -immovable- insisting the other bends.. that doesn’t bode well for a deal #Brexit
This always sets EU teeth on edge. 
On George Eustice Marr repeats UK “only”asking for trade deal like EU already has w Canada” BUT Brussels repeats UK asking for far more: tariff +quota free access to single market, cabotage, police +judicial cooperation, access to EUdata bases..
*EU army under EU Commission control* is what Germany’s Social Democrats are now calling for, says Die Welt newspaper. 
The party is in coalition gov with Angela Merkel’s CDU. 
EU army, rather than military co-op between EU members is not mainstream thinking
Germany. 
#coronavirus humour. 
Tweeted out by Angela Merkel’s spokesman. 
Now a serious message for all thanks to subtitles by @antoni_UK 👇 https://twitter.com/antoni_UK/status/1327696963274465287
P.Lambert MEP doesn’t speak for EU leaders. 
The fate of Dominic Cummings is watched with interest by EU figures who’ve become fascinated by what they see as the UK psychodrama since the 2016 #Brexit vote BUT those close to negotiations still see no deal as a distinct possibility
How to reach a deal? 
#Brexit 
You first .. No, no: after you .. No, you first, I insist .. 
#Brexitnegotiations 
#Brexitcast
Maybe word’s got out that I’m rather partial to the old sequins
IF there’s a deal to be done with UK, EU will not want to endanger it with process. 
EU Parliament needs time to read deal before ratifying it BUT according to influential EU diplomat: 
“If Parliament has to reconvene after Christmas to ratify deal - then so be it” ... 
#Brexit
Same old arguments. 
But every day closer to end of transition period. Deal is still possible. 
General concensus in EU: that decision lies in Downing Street
EU still insists UK trying to get unrivalled access to single market while wanting to diverge as much as possibile on standards/regulations while U.K. blames EU for continuing to want to tie it to Brussels’ and not accepting post #Brexit reality
Suggestion by one diplomat that no deal might be useful “to clear the air” between U.K. and EU at this stage. 
Otherwise, he said, relations would be tense “from day one” after deal signed as both sides so far apart on common standards argument
EU diplomats sounding pessimistic about EU-UK negotiations. “Two weeks ago it seemed more positive. 
Now the only thing that’s moving is time” according to one well-placed source #Brexit
We’re talking about 2 different things. 
This is not parliaments voting on the deal itself. 
These are a handful of member states where a minister/leader cannot sign off on a deal on behalf of the country unless their parliament first votes to give them that ‘power of attorney’
Rational is EU wanting to avoid no deal IF there’s a deal to be had (at mo. everyone I speak to sounds pessimistic/unsure about UK intentions). 
Generally last date for deal now said to be 19 Nov EU-side but, if pushed, then I hear last week Nov from diplomats
EU underlining time really is running out to agree a post #Brexit trade deal👇
EU-insiders now say ‘last possible’ moment is last week of November. 
NB 4/5 National parliaments in EU then need to give approval before their gov can sign a deal. 
EU Parliament needs time to read too
Toll mit Dir zu reden. 
Nochmals bitte ich um Entschuldigung, dass mein Deutschesbrexitlexicon etwas gefehlt hat !
