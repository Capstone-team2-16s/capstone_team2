and I mean who among us would not love to discover the next Pachycephalosaurus but I also have to convey to him that we should not begin extensive excavation projects in our neighbor‚Äôs front yard
Something I find very cool is how paleontologists are literally discovering new dinosaurs all the time, a fact that has instilled in my 3yo the sense that at any moment he‚Äôll discover a new dinosaur fossil which is delightful but also significantly slows down any walk to the park
Trying not to step on the loud part of the floor at night so my kids don't wake up 
thanks!

I think often of Baldwin‚Äôs 1963 essay ‚ÄúA Talk To Teachers‚Äù where he says teachers must help Black children understand that *they* are not criminal, but that the *society* that created the conditions they were born into is the criminal. 
It‚Äôs the same today.
starting this today!
it‚Äôs really great. 
thanks for writing it!
Just finished LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND by @Rumaan. 
A beautifully written and utterly fascinating novel that rejects any easy categorization. 
It's sort of a thriller, but it's also a really compelling meditation on how humans behave when we realize we're not in control. 
Great book.
I still believe in his long term project yea
Well when you put it that way...
thanks for having me!
they‚Äôre completely shameless 
Congrats to the legend!
