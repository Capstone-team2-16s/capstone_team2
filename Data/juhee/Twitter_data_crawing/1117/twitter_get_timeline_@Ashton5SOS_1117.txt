Happy National Drummer Day! ❤️
Omg crazy!!!! Massive milestone for my second ever banger!
Thank you for listening everyone, this is pretty jaw dropping for me. 
I’m really proud of this record and to see how you’re connecting with it makes me feel like I’m doing something really real and true ❤️
😀
I shot this cover at home with my partner @kaykay. 
We wanted something that looked like “pop / grunge” with the feeling of a sinister empty room to represent the feeling of codependency.
Heart-Shaped Box is lined with one of the most beautiful melodies wrapped in barbed wire. 
Kurt Cobain’s mastery is being respected in my cover in many ways. 
One of them being I by no means tried to sing it like him, I gave it my own take. Enjoy.
It’s beautifully shot and the grading is exceptional. 
Lenny is a master stage Performer and a fluid creative soul! 
Check it 🥰🙏
If you know me you know I am a massive fan of @LennyKravitz. 
I wanted to share this with you if you’re stuck at home today. 
This is one of my favorite “rock doc’s” ever.
