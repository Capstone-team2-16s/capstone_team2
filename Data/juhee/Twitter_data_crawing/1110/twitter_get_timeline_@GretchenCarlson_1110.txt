GOOD NEWS! 
@pfizer and @BioNTech_Group #coronavirus vaccine said to be 90% effective with 50 m doses available by December — no side effects. 
2 other vaccine candidates to unveil results over the next few weeks.

Former President George W. Bush congratulated President-elect Joe Biden in a phone call Sunday and said that, while President Donald Trump has the right to pursue legal challenges and recounts, the 2020 race was "fundamentally fair" and "its outcome is clear."
Thank you for this message of hope @JoeBiden. 
Unity is my goal too - doesn’t mean I’m being unrealistic or that i don’t understand both sides b/c I do. 
The last 4 yrs - so many fractured families & friendships, so if we don’t have hope - what do we have? 
More hate?
So sad. 
Thank you for such a great show!
On Eagle's wings ... yes ... He will lift us up. 
Yes he will.
agree
@JoeBiden  I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me and for those who did." 
YES! Cooperate. 
Please bring the parties back together. 
"The American people want us to cooperate for their interests."
@JoeBiden "this is a time to heal in america". 
yes! im for that. 
I've been preaching that for the last 4 years. 
we must come together.
@JoeBiden asks Trump supporters to give each other a chance -- time to put away the harsh rhetoric and see and listen to each other again. 
AGREE.
"While I may be the first woman in power I don't be the last". 
Please NEVER forget that. 
We've got this #forallwomen -- we've broken the glass ceiling now. 
The world is in front of us. 
Little girls KNOW NOW because they see it!
Yes women who have fought for equality and liberty and justice for all - thank you. 
You helped hold up a woman standing tonight on the stage as VP elect. 
Thank you @JoeBiden for selecting a woman as yourVP b/c this is a country of possibilities.

Happy Happy!

This is what I've been asking myself all day. 
God save us. 
This ......

Happy bday!!!

We’ve always known women are warriors, but now age old science may be proving it.

Would that be my vote that I dropped off at a drop of box on Monday that probably wasn’t counted until Election Day or later? 
Trust me - it was legal. 
#PresidentialElection
Will be interesting to see how Fox News reports this. 
Wow
But it works both ways. 
The counting in AZ for example is helping President Trump right?
Should we count the votes in all outstanding states or just the ones that favor certain candidates? 
Come on.
We're smarter than that. 
#PresidentialElection2020
Thank you!  Love you! 
Wow what a fantastic story!!!! 
Was fun to have my friend @PatMItchell as my #WomanOfTheWeek on my news podcast #GetTheNewsWithGretchen on @QuakeMedia. 
Check out her full interview being released today by subscribing at https://bit.ly/37OgA0e
scary. 
we live in a democracy. 
these are votes that people cast by choosing to mail in or drop them off instead of going to the polls. 
that's legal.
Listening to @smerconish now on @cnn. Smart. 
"Fraud is a stinging word and you can't just throw that label around or theft without backing it up. 
Trump is entitled to a fair count but you can't make baseless accusations. 
Show me something." Ditto. 
#PresidentialElection2020
Thanks @NickLaparra -- next time in person! 
omg
polling is dead I believe no matter what side you're on
I think we can all agree the polling industry is DEAD. 
thank you. 
#Election2020
Love Jodi!
Yes!!!
What does Bella think about #Election2020 ? 
Who would she vote for if she could! 
ID NEED A CHARDONNAY TO DO THE POLL
I've been getting calls about how im going to vote in North Carolina for the last 6 months. 
NEWS ALERT: I don't live in NC. 
#ElectionNight
send it over
Ballot counting is what’s keeping me up at night in today’s #GetTheNewsWIthGretchen on @QuakeMedia 
#Election2020 
about to go to Snickers
Ok does she know I'm drinking? 
My daughter just asked me "What is the anti-derivative of the reverse tangent of 2y?" 
Not that I'd know when I'm not drinking .... #Election2020 
#ElectionNight
OMG hysterical!
Can someone tell me if my dropped off ballot will even be counted? 
I need to know! 
#ElectionNight
he has always owned this ...
I love that my teenage kids (for the 1st time in a long time haha) are staying in the kitchen-family room area tonight to watch election coverage and asking me 24/7 "What's going on?" while doing homework. 
Making our kids interested in politics is essential! 
#ElectionNight
States to watch tonight! 
#GetTheNewsWIthGretchenCarlson
#Election2020
im not worried about that ... haha
3 years ago I was giving my @TEDTalks -- not sure which one was more nerve-wracking -- Ted Talk or Election Night. 
This time I can drink though ... so there's that. 
#ElectionNight
