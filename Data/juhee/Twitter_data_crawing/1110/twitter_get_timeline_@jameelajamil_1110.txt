So so amazing
The Indian has a name. 
The Indian is also Black. 
This is why it would be easier to use her name Kamala Harris, just as you did for Biden, rather than calling him the White, you obsolete dying wasp of a clown. 
Ahahahahaha not a bad shout. 
I would like that.
This happened and it was one of the most fun days of my entire career. 
A dream come true. 
They are phenomenal. 
The most present, emotionally supportive and intelligent, overwhelmingly kind and fun women you could ever ask to sit at any table with. 
It’s absolutely fine and hilarious.
So when I took a twitter break a third party app started entering my account and deleting my tweets. 
I would suggest anyone else experiencing random deletes checks and revokes third party apps in their settings, and puts the 2 factor authentication on their accounts. 😂👍🏽❤️
Zero notifications
I know: but I didn’t. 
I wake up and they’re gone
I’ve changed my password so I don’t think so
Lol. It’s happened again. 
Everything I’ve tweeted before yesterday morning, deleted, again, no warning or explanation from @Twitter 
I mean... it’s fine...truly nobody needs my tweets but I would like to understand how and why this is happening. 
This tweet won’t last long I bet!😂
This released endorphins in my brain. 
What??
Yep. They just delete and it says deleted by the author. 
And I haven’t deleted them...
Calm down incel.
My (totally uncontroversial) tweets keep being randomly deleted which is not exactly some big loss for the world, but also sorry to anyone who was in a conversation with me who thinks I just deleted our exchange. 
I’m not sure what’s going on. 
They don’t even notify me. 
@Twitter

LOL ❤️
Slept so well.
