Honestly, with the way touring’s going, I’d do it for a panini and a Diet Coke
It’s just a mess rn, haven’t done anything to it since I shot skinny. 
Sorry 😂 
I’m looking kinda chaotic
Well, this day was nerve racking because we didn’t have any experience (or business) doing photo shoots. 
This was our first one ever and it was super awkward 🤣
Maybe... but a song like this goes a lot further when it’s handled with care. 
Lots of people love it and it hasn’t been promoted to death. 
Also at the time I don’t think radio woulda dug it that much
Aw you sound lovely. 
You have a wholesome tone and a fantastic natural vibrato! 
You rule! 
Thanks for sharing with us!
These are amazing. 
Saving them all!
Today mark’s an amazing success for @5sos album youngblood and the song “Ghost Of You”. 
This song wasn’t a single but has managed to rack up an incredible 100 million streams. 
Mind blown. 
Thank you everyone! ❤️
“No I can’t, live a lie, you can’t make me.” 
“I’m to blame” was inspired by the seductive darkness of The Rolling Stones “paint it black”. 
I wrote the song with Matt P about a psychedelic trip.
