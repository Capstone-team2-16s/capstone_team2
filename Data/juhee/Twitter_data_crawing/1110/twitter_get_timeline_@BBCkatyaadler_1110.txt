Internal Market Bill. 
No10 still defending clauses as necessary safety net. 
But reinstating them risks provoking Pres-elect Biden who says he worries about Good Friday Agreement. 
Also risks European Parliament vetoing EU-UK trade deal even if one decided in next couple of weeks
Trade talks w EU resume this morning. 
Both sides admit they’re still far apart on key issues: 
fish, governance of deal, competition regulations. 
Added frisson today: House of Lords expected to vote to remove controversial clauses on post #Brexit

Biden Presidency: the EU, the UK and #Brexit My thoughts: https://t.co/z7TKMg63a0
No 10 says during their call today the PM and European Commission President “agreed negotiating teams would continue talks in London next week, beginning on Monday, to redouble efforts to reach a deal.
They agreed to remain in personal contact about the negotiations.”
#Brexit
Talks to talk more.. 
For how long more?? 👇 https://t.co/mfVE7NlkIv
PM to speak to European Commission President tomorrow afternoon .. 
#brexit 
What does Washington have to do with the price of fish - if anything ?? 
Plus other musings as to why the pace of post #Brexit EU-UK negotiations slowed yet again this week👇
With both sides agreeing big gaps remain on all 3 outstanding issues (fish, competition regulations and governance of deal) it’s clear the latest (in long line of) cited cut-off point for talks - the EU had said that was 15 Nov - will be busted and further delayed
Expectations are: talks will resume Monday. 
Teams worked the last two weekends. 
Not this coming one. 
Negotiating week predicted to be ‘intensive’ BUT
Talks have not broken off altogether this week. 
Technical negotiations  continue today and tomorrow. 
Chief negotiators Frost and Barnier are expected to speak by phone. 
The next round of talks are scheduled to be in London. 
Timetable described as ‘very fluid’
But UK sources push back at this analysis. They speak instead of the « natural ebb and flow » of negotiations and insist UK has continued to be constructive. 
They say the EU describes talks as constructive only when things going their way
EU voices muse whether the PM is waiting till all backs against the wall time-wise before clinching the deal. 
For domestic political reasons. 
« Boris Johnson is certainly not personally involved in haggling over herring or individual fishing issues » remarked one EU diplomat
As always, it depends who you speak to. 
EU diplomats wonder aloud whether No10 is hedging its bets on the best (or least worst) timing to make concessions necessary to agree a trade deal with EU. 
Brussels can see the difficulties the PM already faces over Lockdown2 with own MPs
Has UK really slowed down trade talks with EU until #USElectionResults become crystal clear? 
No, says UK. 
We don’t get that impression, says EU. 
Yet sources in Brussels insist the UK did put the brakes on intensive negotiations this week. 
So what is going on? 
#Brexit
een advised not to expect news of big breakthroughs as EU Chief negotiator Michel Barnier this afternoon updates member states on state of play in negotiations with UK. 
Predicted to be more of a ‚motivational‘ briefing à la „it’s worth keeping going with these talks“ #Brexit
The EU is now preparing for a period of instability across the Atlantic following this election. 
Brussels admits too that if even if Biden becomes president his priority will be a multitude of domestic concerns before he really turns his attention to overseas relations
Although the tone from Washington would likely be different, the EU thinks the content of clashes over trade, tech taxes, surveillance and more could well continue (though to a lesser degree esp on trade) under Biden
There’s a European expectation that Biden would reverse the perceived Trump trend of preferring to court authoritarian leaders rather than nurture relations with traditional allies BUT
EU leaders quietly hope for a Biden victory. 
There are stand-out exceptions: 
Hungary’s Victor Orban is an open admirer of Trump but  general feeling is the last 4 years have done a lot of damage to EU-US relations and a Biden presidency may not heal that #USElection2020
EU attempts to create own defence force are fraught with countless difficulties: 
practical, political, logistic Trump isn’t first US President to call on Europeans to spend more on Defence but Europeans fear if Trump returns to office he might weaken or destroy NATO altogether.
Clearly they know Europe stronger with US by its side eg on China, Iran, climate. 
Their argument esp tricky when comes to security . 
Europe has looked to US to have its back in security terms since WW2. 
Having Trump in White House has led Europeans to doubt that assumption 
Germany‘s Economy Minister and France‘s Europe Minister separately observe that Europe cant wait for its fate to be decided by politics in US. 
Saying that 4 years of Trump presidency have shown Europe it needs to determine own path when comes to economy, climate, tech and more
