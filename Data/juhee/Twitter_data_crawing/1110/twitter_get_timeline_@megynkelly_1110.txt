Oh you seem sweet. 
Maybe unfollow me since I upset you so very much. 
Up to you!
Honey, you should unfollow! 
Free yourself babe.
This is perfect. 
In an attempt to support my claim that Biden’s pronouncement of “unity” & “healing” was not realistic, that we are too divided, this actor (shock: he hates Republicans) decides to mock the reasons Rs aren’t feeling so chummy. 
Thanks for making my point!
For those confused, Chris Cuomo retweeted that little acting tweet - wanted me to see it - and thankfully I did!
Omg @ChrisCuomo! 
I totally thought this was you doing more terrible acting like when you had COVID (while your brother was killing off 6k seniors) &, after exposing half ur neighborhood while not wearing your mask, did your fake emergence from the basement! But this guy is better
You’re making my initial point of the day, Sir. Tell it to Mr. Biden.
You have every right to your anger Ted. 
As do GOP voters who have been unfairly vilified by leaders on the L. 
And it won’t go away, in either case, bc a politician wins & tweets “Healed!” He needs to start at home. 
Talk to AOC & the media re: unity. 
Then some GOPers might listen.

My podcast is already killing it so, no sweetheart.
Thanks @DrewHolden360
I think it’s clear I have a lot on my mind today. 
More on my podcast on Monday, here: https://t.co/SNfLLcsWMB 
Hope you will subscribe- let’s talk.
Btw ⁦@mattwilstein⁩ - ur mag published this piece of shit article re: me when I wouldn’t defend R Ailes. 
So you can take a seat on “oh how we all used to rally for MK.” 
This piece was meant to shame other women from spkg up & DB ran w/it with glee.
Joan, I am trying to explain the mindset of the right half of the country, which I happen to understand, unlike most in the media. 
You may find it helpful, you may not. 
But the notion that I should make it all about me & Trump’s comments is absurd. 
I moved past it long ago.
I never needed your rallying. 
This isn’t about me. 
Tho I do know how you on the far Left (of whom rational liberals are embarrassed) love a person to play the victim.
No
Martina, the vitriol went well beyond Trump-some 70m ppl have been called vile, bigots, racists & xenophobes & are now being threatened w/being put on target “lists” as punishment for supporting him. 
They’ve been demonized by the very ppl now sanctimoniously demanding “civility.”
See? 
If you are a voter ticked off about being called a racist, xenophobic, sexist bigot for the past four years it is your “white fear” similar to after the Civil War. 
Good grief.
- Leftists/media re GOP: “racists! Xenophobes! Uncaring bigots!”

- Biden wins. “Unity!”

- Trump supporters: “Eh, not feeling it.”

- Leftists/media: “please be more responsible in your language.”
Not just him. 
Anyone who supported him. 
Oh no. Oh this is too sad. 
Thank you for entertaining us all these years, Alex. 
Rest In Peace. 
You can be as angry as you want. 
But let’s not pretend after 4 yrs of bare knuckled, brutal, and grossly vicious brawling, now that your guy is ascending to the WH, it’s all over and “unity,” “healing,” peace, love & understanding bc ... memory.
Not trying to fight you either Austan but be realistic- here is what is coming out of your party right now:
I would love nothing more. 
Might be tough with the reality on the ground: https://t.co/UO7r4MsUCY
Ian, you’re out of touch if you think 70m Americans who have been unfairly demonized as the worst of humanity for 4yrs are now going to hug those who’ve viciously attacked them (& are now making lists of their names). 
I’m talking reality, which is my job, not pie-in-the-sky stuff
Biden calls for “unity” and “healing” - perhaps he should take it up first with the loudest voices of his own party? 
No. Half of the country has been demonized as awful for four years just for supporting their president who was falsely accused of Russian collaboration, wrongly impeached & attacked relentlessly by the L & a dishonest media. 
And now it’s “let’s heal!” “Unity!” 
Good luck.
Awesome. 
I’m rooting for you in your journey!
I agree w/you that Biden doesn’t think that.
But a large faction of his supporters & media (but I repeat myself) do & have been peddling that vitriol for 4 yrs. 
I know ur happy he won, but to pretend this is now the “unity” era is to be willfully blind to reality.
You have zero understanding of the mood of 70 million Americans who have been unfairly attacked relentlessly for the past four years as awful ppl just for supporting their president.
Pathetic and once again more proof that you only know how to sling mud &amp; debase yourself.
It’s not about me. 
It’s about the country.
I’m call them like I see them, same as u. 
He is out of touch if he thinks his election means unity/hsed (& continue to) half the nation as evil for 4 yrs.ealing in a nation in which his supporters have dismis 
Top Ds are right now threatening anyone who “enabled” him. 
Go fix that.
No. Half of the country has been demonized as awful for four years just for supporting their president who was falsely accused of Russian collaboration, wrongly impeached & attacked relentlessly by the L & a dishonest media. 
And now it’s “let’s heal!” “Unity!” 
Good luck.
From anyone other than you, that might resonate.
You have zero understanding of the mood of 70 million Americans who have been unfairly attacked relentlessly for the past four years as awful ppl just for supporting their president.
Then it’s delusional & out of touch. 
Republicans have been told for 4 years that they’re racist, sexist, xenophobic bigots if they support Trump & now suddenly it’s “let’s heal! Unite!” 
It’s not going to happen. 
He should check Twitter to see what D’s are saying re “lists” etc.
It isn’t true. At all.
Written like a man who’s been in his basement for a year.
Prayers up 🙏🏻 - will light a candle too. 
God bless her.
I do when it comes to being not driven by politics or ideology, which most of the country is not.
Congrats to those feeling happy about Biden’s win. 
Empathy to those who are disappointed &amp; upset. 
All I know is we are lucky enough to live in the USA—greatest country on earth—& none of the unhinged reactions (D & R) to today’s news represent most of us.
It’s gonna be exactly the opposite.
What an awesome tweet for the Georgia GOP to plaster everywhere in their effort to ensure Republicans keep the Senate.
Omg me too -  HE IS HILARIOUS!
Yes! Anywhere you get podcasts. 
It’s free!
Pelosi says Biden has a “huge mandate.” 
Really? Dems lost seats when supposed to gain them in her chamber, d/n/gain control of Senate, saw DT win more votes than ever with minority groups, & did not see the promised Blue Wave. 
Truth will prevail in Jan. 
when gridlock settles in.
It’s on all platforms! Free!
I absolutely loved re-connecting. 
Thank you for doing it @scrowder!
Trump is right to make sure we had a fair election. 
To ensure there’s no widespread proof of voter fraud that could change the result. 
And then, when it becomes clear-as it now is-that it is over for him, he must do the gracious, patriotic, right thing: concede, & pass the torch.
Prepare to laugh, think, be offended (?) &amp; entertained w/the one &amp; only @scrowder. 
From the Fox call on AZ, to Big Tech cracking down on him, depression, sex, infertility...& some lol stories about my pal John Stossel - enjoy.
Fox calls WI for Biden. 
As to AZ, Fox Decision Desk has been bulletproof on calls for nearly 20 yrs. 
The call changes only if massive probs in AZ reporting (highly unlikely). 
That means no path for DT w/o PA & MI and MI starting to look out of reach. 
PA may wind up irrelevant.
Doh!
Wth??
“Uncle Clarence?” 
Are you kidding me?? 
I’m going to bed but my bleary thoughts as I drift off to sleep are: 
DT wins MI, loses WI and it all comes down to PA, which clearly needs a lesson from FL in how to count its votes faster!
My read on Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk)’s mssg:  
Trump struggling in WI. 
Going to win GA. Needs MI and PA. 
Could do it but won’t know for a while.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk):
Michigan: 
Trump is currently in the lead; did “extremely well” in Election Day voting, 
but still must count early & mail-in votes (which happens later). 
Final result will “be much closer.” 
Biden better here than in GA.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk) - Trump needs MT, GA, NC &amp; PA. 
He then needs also WI or MI.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk) - PA could easily take several days to count. 
Need everyone on Decision Desk to agree who has won; and then need to see how almost certain litigation shakes out.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk) says Biden has the advantage in Wisconsin.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk) - should be able to call Georgia soon - suggests it will likely go for Trump.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk): 
Trump has an advantage in NC (w/94% reporting), we’re just not sure it’s a callable advantage yet.
Checking my math...
If DT holds PA but loses MI *and* WI, that’s 269, right?
Trump wins Texas
Trump wins Ohio per Fox News
Fox News calling the first flip of the night: 
Arizona for Biden. 
11 electoral votes.
Stacey Abrams too
Thanks Rav - I appreciate it.
Thank you. 💕
About to join @BenShapiro and the @realDailyWire team to talk about the election results tonight. 
Subscribe to my podcast tonight to be the first to get @megynkellyshow analysis tomorrow.
Great news for all - congratulations! 
FYI re: @NateSilver538 prediction in FL: https://t.co/qVrvU3XH5l
Florida looking very good for Trump. 
Panhandle will be very red - that’s what we’re waiting on and Team Trump must be feeling a little relieved.
Four years ago we met with the Fox News Decision Desk guys at 5p (they’d seen the 1st wave of exit polls). 
These are straight shooters, not pundits. 
The headline was “it’s going to be a very good night for Hillary Clinton.” 
It’s anyone’s race, folks.
Looking forward to it! 
Thank you for this! 
I’ve had so much I’ve wanted to say. 
Feels good to call the balls &amp; strikes. 
JD, you’re the greatest! 
Can’t wait to have you on the show! 💕
No, she isn’t. And guess what? 
She’s on there for life.
My take on where we are... an awful media bent on destroying itself ... and why Trump voters have nothing to be ashamed of.
Personally I like the little details - really brought me there!
