“Unity is great, but freedom is better. 
There’s a part of this population that has sacrificed their freedom time and time again for unity, and they’re tired of it...so if you’re asking us to come together, and that means my world doesn’t change…
I don’t want that kind of unity.”
congrats, errin!
congrats, karen!
Well that was embarrassing 
Something important that this incoming administration The Trump administration started carrying out the first federal executions in almost 20 years. 
All scheduled federal executions should be stopped. 
The death penalty should be abolished.
nonstop lmao
lol I was like damn when did fireworks become so advanced!
😂
Ah okay they’re drones. 
Got it.
Black family group chats everywhere blowing up.
Damn I can’t even lie I didn’t know fireworks could do this
Indeed he is
This is so important to so many. 
I so wish John Lewis could have seen this.
So many people worked so hard for this to happen. 
So many people whose names aren’t in the spotlight but whose persistent work in their communities, in their cities, and in their states made this possible. 
Their work doesn’t end now, it always continues. 
I’m grateful for them.
I’m just trying to be like him
💯
Well cotdamn
Over the past few years I've spoken to many older Black folks who lived through the Civil Rights Movement, time & time again they told me how they couldn't wait until November 2020 so they could vote this man out & protect what had been gained in the 60s. Thinking of them today.
congrats, jane!
Can’t stop thinking about how different all of this would feel if these states had been allowed to start counting mail-in ballots weeks ago.
It says a lot about Stacey Abrams that her first tweet after Georgia turns blue is to shout out the other organizers and people who helped make it happen.
 damn son so you’re an oracle now
happy birthday, zoé!
I don’t know about you all, but I’m a big Joe Willock fan. And he’s still so young.
Watching all of this unfold in places like Philly, Detroit, and Atlanta, I just can't stop thinking about the decades, really the centuries, of pathology surrounding Black ppl and the vote. 
The way Black folks have been scapegoated & maligned, but continue to come through anyway.
This tweet deserves a Pulitzer
John Lewis reaching down to guide things over the finish line
“The Black vote in Detroit is the highest it’s ever been, and we will determine the outcome, because we’ve gone from picking cotton to picking presidents.”
I'm thinking especially of the young activists and organizers of color who have spent years knocking on doors, politically educating their communities, petitioning, protesting and everything else that happens when there is no spotlight on you, but that makes real change possible.
There are going to be a lot of different narratives in the comings days, weeks, and years about this election, but what I know for sure is that things would look very different (much worse) if it wasn't for those who've committed their entire lives to organizing around justice.
I'm really grateful for the work of organizers across the country who fight—not just during election cycles but every single day—for restorative instead of punitive justice, for higher wages, for health care, & whose work continues to make a profound difference in people's lives.
When you cast your ballot today, remember the millions of incarcerated people who can’t.
