This right here is a CD i burnt of Superbloom as soon as I finished it.
I took one to Calum, gave one to my friend’s Matt and Dan and then Posted one to my Mum in Australia.

I got way too excited on the guitar 🤣 fully ripping a solo on an acoustic 🤣

You hear in this voice memo my voice and matt pauling on guitar, discovering the song that would inspire a whole record.

Have u found what ur looking for?

comes out everywhere this Friday and I can’t wait for you to hear it. - A i 

Sharing the first ever voice memo of a song that’s freshly written is, to be honest, absolutely terrifying. ut in my opinion, the purest form of a song, before we turn it into a full production.

This is the genesis of my record SUPERBLOOM.
This song is about overcoming mental resistance, and facing every fear you’ve ever had.
This is “Have u found what ur looking for?”.

Out Friday at midnight local time - A i 



Listening to the test press of vinyl of #superbloom.
My heart is racing and I have one million feelings about what this album really means to me.

Hey skinny skinny.
Don’t you think about the future.
