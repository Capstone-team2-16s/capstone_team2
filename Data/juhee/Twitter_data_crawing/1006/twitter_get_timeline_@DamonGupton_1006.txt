Unbelievable
Thomas Jefferson Byrd.

My God.
What the hell.
Wow.

This is awful news.

Yeah man

Didn’t know where you grew up cat, and not sure what you mean about my objectives.

Truth be told, had no idea Hartford loyalty swung to the Patriots.

Good to know, cuz I truly personally didn’t know any lifelong Patriots fans outside of my gf and her folks.


Amen

Sorry about Cam by the way.

I was looking forward to that game today.

Ahhhhh.

Good to know.

Always or when they got good? 
My gf is from Boston, so she’s both suffered and triumphed


Yup.

They have earned nothing from me.

I’m a Cowboys “victim” too, lol

Can you help me get this to Jerry?
Dear Jerry Jones: For the sake of the lifelong love and loyalty I’ve had with the Dallas Cowboys, please let all your team kneel and take that knee, because they are in serious need of some prayer right now.
#Cowboys

I do agree.
It’s a shame.

😂😂😂 Youre kidding right...they aren’t exactly top of the food chain right now are they? 
Props on that one super bowl year with Foles...but it’s been rough over there.
#never

My request to Jerry:
Dear Jerry Jones: For the sake of the lifelong love and loyalty I’ve had with the Dallas Cowboys, please let all your team kneel and take that knee, because they are in serious need of some prayer right now.
#Cowboys

Yeah.

Did the tour too.

Been waiting for them to EARN my right to purchase tickets and see my first home game there.

#Cowboys

Yup.

No change upstairs, no change downstairs.

No identity.

No mental toughness.

Embarrassment upon embarrassment.

Yeah.

It’s rough.

They’re cursed.

Jerry’s cursed.

I’ve held out hope to see them in the NFC Championship game or the Super Bowl again in my lifetime, but I don’t have high hopes.

You a Rams fan?

He can kiss my...

Amen

No words for how bad and idiotic the Cowboys are right now.

All this skill and yet all this incompetence.
And you all have the nerve to think you earn my lifelong fandom.
Tired of you needing a miracle, get some damn results and execute.

Pathetic.

If only the ‘Boys could play real defense ☹️
Oh...
Daryl Worley is on Odell Beckham Jr....
I can sleep well now 🙄 #Cowboys

Yup

True

He betta KEEP playing...cuz lord knows my boys have NO defense
I’m glad this cat ain’t my doctor.

Wow.

Unreal.
Smdh.

Amen

They seem to be trying very hard.
I feel like Don Lemon is really trying hard not to break out laughing.

Lol

Utter and disgraceful evil.

Been disgusted by this all day.

It’s so blatant and clear and unjust.

I dont know how these people sleep at night knowing they are cheaters.

Fact about the bs Abbott pulled in Texas today.


Important

I’m still so disgusted the Clippers kicked him out like that.

Always will be.

Yup. 
Been seething and posting about this all day.

Losers and cheaters.

Bravo man
Evil, cheating, cowardly, scared bastards.

This is beyond ridiculous. 


Alright now Chapman, dammit, I wasn’t ready to be shedding tears yet today ❤️

I hear you

Fantastic 🙏

Lol. 
Yeah man. 
Madness.

Always

I just bought this a few weeks ago.
Freddie 🙏

Doc was worth more than that.

He definitely should have gotten another year to build on.

And who do you get now that will lead like that? 
My fear is that the team will fall apart completely now.

That’s exactly what I told my girlfriend.
She thought they would fire him.

She was right.

I still can’t believe it.

A pandemic, injuries, lack of playing time, the bubble, Lou’s chicken wings, Trez’s grandmothers death, load management, PG’s depression, racism and boycotts...

I love this woman.

My heart hurts for Doc.
Dude was class
These are facts.

It happened.

Amen

I woke up resolved.

Again.

🙏

Amen

Amen

Sheer and utter.
Clarification...for those who need it...which ain’t many of us most likely

“Stand back and stand by.” You heard those words. 
They will be remembered.

Very kind of you.
Thank you.

GREAT spot on MSNBC today man.
Hope you and yours are well.

Lol, yes.

It was nice to see him again, especially on a project of this magnitude.

Hope you and yours are well in the storms.

@DocRivers This broke my heart today.

We love you coach and can’t stand this news.

You deserved better.

This was not a normal year, this is not a normal time, and you are not just some normal coach.

This one stings bad.

Amen.
Saddened to hear this news.

Doc Rivers deserved better than that.
Wow.
He deserved at least another year given what 2020 was. Cold game. 
#Clippers

My floodgates have opened
