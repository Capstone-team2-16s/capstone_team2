Proud to have co-hosted a fundraiser for @HarrisonJaime.

One of my favorite things about him ‚Äî after graduating from Yale on scholarship, but before he went on to law school, he went back to his home town and worked as a teacher for a year at his own high school. 
Good guy.

Looking for voice actors for this new project with 
@JohnLithgow:
Record yourself reading his poem #TrumptyDumpty Wanted a Crown. Feel free to put your own spin on it. 
Check out the script here: https://hitrecord.app.link/trumpty

Btw, the full video with me and @JohnLithgow is too long for twitter, but you can watch it here: https://t.co/uB1uxPAZYR

Now we‚Äôre doing a @HITRECORD project inspired by his new book, #TrumptyDumpty Wanted A Crown. 
If you feel like doing some acting, reading rhymes, delivering dark political satire against a despotic president that deserves to be dethroned, come jump in:

Beyond my family, perhaps the most influential people in my whole life were the kind souls who guided me through a blessed & weird adolescence as I acted on #3rdRockFromThe Sun. 
@JohnLithgow taught me so much about being funny, being an artist, and being a good human.

Show me a photo of something that always puts you in a good mood. No matter how shitty your day‚Äôs been. Post it here: https://hitrecord.app.link/makesmehappy
