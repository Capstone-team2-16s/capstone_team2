Condolences, this is a nightmare, and it‚Äôs got to be incredibly painful to see the president of the USA be so selfish and reckless about Covid-19 after losing your Father to it.

Women‚Äôs rights over their own bodies! 
White supremacy pushed back into its swamp hole and immigrants (which we all are except Native Americans) treated with Dignity. 
Yes.

I want to see @KimMangone defeat Kevin McCarthy!

Use your vote, you are worth it. 

I want to live in an America where we don‚Äôt do heinous things to immigrants like lock them in cages, separate them from their families, hold them in concentration camps and take out their reproductive systems without their consent or knowledge. 
#WithBidenWeCan

SMDH. 
I want to live in an America where our President is responsible and care enough about other people to help STOP the spread of Covid 19, not be a SUPER-SPREADER.

Your Fired! 
Trump can‚Äôt get his act together. 
He makes the whole country unstable with his refusal to do what‚Äôs right, follow the medical experts and CDC, follow norms of government. 
His selfish delusion and his lack of impulse control makes him unfit for President.

@CuomoPrimeTime is having the conversation all need to hear as this president is calling for violence, intimidation at the polls and a refusal to leave even if he looses. Real.

Thank you for the great work you are doing!

Glad to see the Marvel family embiggening! 
Welcome, Iman / Ms. Marvel! 

This is not even close to enough. 
Hate crimes have spiked here and abroad and after last nights debate these lunatics think Trump has given them a green light for mayhem in the streets, and at the polls. 
Shut the hate and misinformation down.

I am with you Bernie!!! 

We have been a country of anti fascists since our beginning no reason to stop now!

And while you are at it, Wolf, let's make sure to remind people that our President not only refused to condemn White Supremacy but he also called out fascist thugs to "Stand By'. 
That's way past "embarrassing" at this point and had zero to do with Biden's debate performance.

Be an Anti-Fascist in all you do. 

I'm doing everything in my power to push back. 
Say it. 
Do it. 
Feel true.

WTF? 
Where are we living?

I want to live in an America where someone living with Drug Addiction isn‚Äôt used as weapon to shame anyone. Especially a candidate for the president of the USA.

We are all facing chaos.
Trump offers only more chaos. Festering Chaos.

Reach out folks, see who is next to you, and hold tight. 
Hold tight to the goodness, fairness, decency and love,  that always has conquered the darkness of chaos.

We must gather together now, shoulder to shoulder and arm in arm. 
Together as humankind, to say ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù to this chaos and hold tight and bravely against it. 
Like this we win.

The time is coming for us to rise together to the goodness of our nation. 
To rise above this chaos and gather in the strength of our Unity.

I know this is hard to get your head around, but let‚Äôs be honest, our President is a Fascist Dictator. 
Who has a fascist gang of thugs standing by.
Real.

People are becoming their own heroes. 
‚ÄúWe have to do it, we do!‚Äô

I am an Ant-Fascist, so was every American that fought in our world wars. 
It‚Äôs STILL a good thing to be.

Remember when Trump said he wanted clean water? 
More BS! 
‚ÄúThis administration hasn‚Äôt taken a single action to reduce the ongoing emissions of PFAS, to clean up legacy PFAS pollution or any take any meaningful action...‚Äù
