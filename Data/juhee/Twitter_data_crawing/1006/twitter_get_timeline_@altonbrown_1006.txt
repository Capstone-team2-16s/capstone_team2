@feartomorrow Well...I do like a big toaster oven

@realtoric Whatever

@JenWallsGonce How can you love me and tell me not to be literal?!?

@wilerichildy Convective broilers

@mcarno Well stated.

@Jacob_Baker2275 It’s a 360 convective broiler

@kruksog Clearly I’m not.
Frying is frying and is defined by immersion in fat.
That’s not pedantry, that’s fact and… https://t.co/1e5WHGbFc7

@bitz4bk Barely

@karinmcmahon EXACTLY!!!

@chewcudda @bourne0513 I endorse this message

@CdnReggie I love this so much

I would have told you your turkey is on fire but didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of Thanksgiving dinner  in another direction.

Absolute truth

It’s the only cookie I dream about.

There is no such thing as “air frying.” 
So stop talking about it like it’s a thing.

Because...no

Can you share the recipe?

On it

I spotted it first, dammit!

I am with you.

Just wrapped the new season of Good Eats: The Return.

Thank you to my crew for not killing me and for amazingly expressing their talents all while wearing masks and face shields and washing their hands 375 times a day.

Cooking up something wicked...delicious.

Don't miss #GoodEatsTheReturn's Halloween special, The House That Dripped Chocolate, coming to @FoodNetwork next Thursday, October 8 at 9 PM EST.

Last night was...our anniversary.
Check out the highlights below, or catch the full show here : https://youtube.com/watch?v=JZUd_A9OpsE&feature=youtu.be 
Sprinkles suck

Two Benadryl and several bourbons...but no not really.

Belize

The hero we need.

Done

Point taken.

I’m not watching anymore.

Embarrassing on both sides.

Dear #Godzilla...NOW!

But is it? Or is it about man’s constant battle with God?

Gentlemen, you can’t fight in here.

This is the war room!

I hear @MerriamWebster is updating their definition of “shit show.”

Hey guys...what’s on TV?

Does that mean “Cutthroat Kitchen?”

The #barbuto cookbook is finally here! 
I have no idea where to start.

Tonight at 8pm eastern #QuarantineQuitchen will be live with @IngramElizabeth and me drinking an appropriate amount in preparation for whatever may happen later...you know...at 9.

Done

Well done!

Professional only!

No. It’s a canapé.

No. It certainly isn’t.

Don’t use carrots.
