Dear Texas: This is what you get for re-electing Ted Cruz: a Supreme Court-stuffer with a merkin on his face (thanks to John Oliver for the merkin).

GOOD NEIGHBORS, by Sarah Langan 
Looks like my cup of blood.
Goes to the top of my want-to-read list.

Trump risked the lives of the Secret Service personnel who were in the drive-by SUV with him. 
Lives risked for a publicity stunt. 
They will need to quarantine for 14 days, doctors say.

My friend and collaborator Rich Chizmar sent me this 
Made me think of the foolish people who STILL refuse to wear masks and social distance: deadly children.,

I‚Äôm so sorry to hear it.

Trump's first order of business when he gets out of the hospital--or while he's still in it, via Twitter--is to issue an apology to the American people in general and his supporters in particular for his reckless example.

Need some get-it-together music this afternoon. 
Starting with Van ‚Äúthe man‚Äù Morrison: Tupelo Honey.

You‚Äôre a dipshit for not taking precautions, but I wish you well.

The Trump mafia: I'd like to knock their stupid, maskless, superspreading heads together. 
You bought it, you paid for it, have a nice fucking day.

Have to admit it sounds like one of mine. 
Except where are the tentacles? There should be tentacles.
Good golly, Trump and his fearless band of goonies spread that shit everywhere, didn't they?
Secret Service agent: ‚ÄúTrump has never cared about us.‚Äù
My mother used to tell me when I was a kid: 
‚ÄúStephen, if you keep looking for trouble, you‚Äôll find it.‚Äù
850 Americans died of COVID-19 yesterday.
None got the special ‚Äúantibody cocktail.‚Äù

FOX AND FRIENDS: Always interesting to check and see what they are NOT talking about. 
Today the non-topic is Trump's flaunting of CDC guidelines re masks.

Wear your mask when with others.

That would be like watching the twins in THE SHINING,only scarier.

MR. MERCEDES on Peacock this month. 
Let‚Äôs roll.

Dear Texas: Your governor, Greg Abbott, is trying to suppress your vote.

Is that Julia Roberts in the Capital One ad?
I'd love to see the closet in Mildred Ratched's motel room. 
That woman's got a TON of fancy clothes. 
Can you imagine the dry cleaning bill?
Trump is an asshole.
Yes, but there is nothing so satisfying of saying‚Äîas one might to Donald Trump‚Äî
‚ÄúYou are a complete numpty.‚Äù
Don: Knock-knock!
Joe: Who's there?
Don: Interrupting racist!
Joe: Interrupting racist w--
Don: PROUD BOYS STAND BY!

Debate Commission and future moderators: 
Remember that when Donald Trump is on that stage, he comes not as president but as just another candidate. 
When it's not his turn to speak, SHUT HIM UP.

The debate commission (whoever they are) needs to discuss ways of stopping Trump in the next 2 debates from the constant interruptions and hectoring. 
No matter who you think "won," as an educational tool for voters, last night was useless.

In the next debate, the moderator(s) have to have the power to cut the mics.

Trump‚Äôs crazy.‚ÄùWE CUGHT EM! We caught em all!‚Äù

You‚Äôve got a decent man vs. a hulking, loudmouth bully with no specific plans on anything.

Cut his mike when he interrupts.

It‚Äôs on.

I'm 4 episodes into RATCHED, and two people have gone into that handy mental institution crematorium. So...batting .500.

Nothing like a shout-out from the one n only Kim Coates.
Enjoying RATCHED 
The music is positively Hitchcockian.
Curious to see how Trump will fare without his cheering section.
Hey hey, ho ho,
#LeningradLindsey has to go.

Molly is better. üòÄ

BAD DAD REHAB! 
To be followed by BAD MOMS IN THE SUN! 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe all the medieval "curative treatments" depicted in RATCHED were actually practiced at one time in mental institutions.

POOL BOY NIGHTMARE sounds like it might be about Jerry Falwell Jr.

The titles aRe sometimes better than the movies, but you never know.

I enjoy Lifetime Movie Network films while doing morning exercises. 
How can you go wrong with DERANGED GRANNY?

Trump supporters, explain to your children why you are supporting an adulterer, draft dodger, liar, and tax cheat. 
Bonus point if you avoid telling them the lie that it‚Äôs ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù
Ellacott. 
My goof, can't blame this one on autocorrect.

TROUBLED BLOOD is as good or better than the other Cormoran Strike/Robin Ellicott novels.
J. K. Rowling is a wonderful storyteller and a gifted stylist. 
I'm loving this one.
