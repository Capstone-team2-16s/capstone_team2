this .....

so wrong

Yes !!!!!

This is so outrageous.
For a photo op? 
You put lives at risk? 
I'm so sorry for the secret service and I pray none get sick or worse.

OMG

Obviously Dr. Conley felt he had to tell the American public more info than yesterday ....
so there were some details.

But then, the same pattern ... more questions with no answers.

#TrumpHasCovid

Potential discharge of President Trump tomorrow from Walter Reade and back to the WH.

#TrumpHasCovid
More honesty from the President's Dr. right now.

#TrumpHasCovid

Happy Saturday! My autographed shoes are now up for auction for the 12th Annual ‚ÄúKick Up Your Heels‚Äù fundraiser to benefit @RivieraTheatre - 
Bid today and support Arts in Education for kids! The arts gave me so much growing up as a violinist!

Question of the day: WHEN WAS THE LAST NEGATIVE TEST THE PRESIDENT OF THE United States RECEIVED? 
#covid19 
#TrumpCovid
funny if it weren't so serious
Just to be clear ...
Fox News not covering this point.


And ... using an experimental therapy on President Trump potentially to thwart the symptoms -- 
maybe so he wouldn't have to tell the American public he had #Covid19 or at the very least when he knew he had it? 
#TrumpCovid

Wow. 
@drsanjaygupta on @cnn saying you have to "order" the antibody treatment (not yet approved) to get it -- for compassionate use -- so when did President Trump know he had #Covid19 ?
#TrumpCovid

So what's the real timeline of when the President knew he was #Covid19 positive? 
His doctor said 72 hours ago.

If that's true he went to NJ and MN knowing he had symptoms? 
#TrumpCovid

totally
And didn't get the test at the debate on Tuesday ...

How will this affect all of the ABC people Christie was sitting next to on debate night LIVE on air? 

Remember. 
Chris Wallace has said President Trump arrived too late to the debate to take a #Covid19 test (as was required).

That was Tuesday night. 
Thursday night he was positive. 
There's more reporting to be done here. 
#TrumpCovid

good point.

meant about my experience

Brit Hume has a history of being a blowhard about things he knows nothing about.

He was one of the first to malign me publicly just like this after I filed my harassment case against Roger Ailes at Fox.

Whose surprised

Exactly ... wish I could comment more about that source

I wish I could comment
Wow

wow

Let me get this straight.

Pres Trumps family refused to wear masks at debate even when asked by Cleveland Clinic reps.

Pres still goes to NJ fundraiser after knowing Hope Hicks tested positive.

At Supreme Court presser attendees shook hands, hugged & were maskless.

How selfish.

How stupid ‚Äî all of those people at the White House event for Supreme Court pick shaking hands and not wearing masks ‚Äî now it‚Äôs turned into a #COVID19 super spreader event.

Let‚Äôs stop arbitration and NDAs too! 

COVID-19 has led 1 in 4 women to contemplate downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce entirely, 1 in 3 moms may be forced to scale back or opt out.

Companies must rise or risk unwinding years of progress for gender equality.

#WomenInTheWorkplace

yes!

I thought this was supposed to end at 1030pmET.

Pls take us all out of our misery.

#PresidentialDebate2020

Depressing

The sad thing is ... take politics out of it ... this is not how we raise our kids. 
Do we teach them to have .... No respect, to bully, to not follow the rules (that his campaign agreed to by the way).

#PresidentialDebate2020

This is embarrassing ...

#PresidentialDebate2020
Agree

Jealous
Haha
Haha

Chris Wallace is appealing to Trump to stop interrupting.

This is like a toddler having a tantrum.
Too bad nobody can get a timeout.

#PresidentialDebate

They need you Doris!

Biden: It‚Äôs hard to get any word in with this clown.
 
#PresidentialDebate

This is a s*** show.

Nobody can control him I don‚Äôt think.

Cut his mic!!!

I have a colonoscopy tomorrow! 
No wine ... no nothing! 

Biden: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst President America has ever had‚Äù 
#PresidentialDebate
Finally ‚Äî Chris Wallace demands an answer about trumps taxes.

#PresidentialDebate

Wallace to Trump: ‚Äúyou‚Äôve agreed to the 2 minutes‚Äù.

This is why they should cut the mic when they don‚Äôt honor the 2 minutes 
#PresidentialDebate2020

Was thinking exact thing

Trump accuses Biden of not being able to get the crowds ‚Äî and if he could ... that Biden would hold the same gatherings he‚Äôs been holding advocating no masks.

#debate

Great idea

Thank you!

Interesting how Joe Biden has been coached to not look at Pres Trump ‚Äî speaking straight forward.

Maybe because Trumps strategy is to malign and degrade.

Quote: ‚ÄúNothing smart about you Joe.‚Äù 
#debate

Trump says he disagrees with his own person on when the vaccine for #covid will be ready.

#debate

Trump: ‚ÄúYou could have never done the job Joe ‚Äî it‚Äôs not in your blood.‚Äù 
#Debates2020 
#debate

Biden finally says it: shut up.

#DebateTuesday 
#debate

Too bad the rule for this debate wasn‚Äôt that the candidates had to wear masks to shut up when the other one is talking.

#DebateTuesday 
#debate

VP Joe Biden takes off the gloves ‚Äî says everything Trump says is a liar.

#Debate2020 
#Debate

Wow ‚Äî Trump trying to steamroll Chris Wallace ‚Äî saying he‚Äôs debating Wallace and saying he‚Äôs not surprised.

#debate

Chris Wallace obviously nervous for this debate ... will he be able to control this debate? 
#Debates2020 
#debatetuesday

So the gloves are off now ‚Äî the discussion portion will be where the fireworks are between Trump and Biden 
- #DebateTuesday

President Trump quoting the Notorious RBG!

Breaking: Many #FoxNews nuggets in this exhaustive rpt by @thedailybeast @TheLloydGrove @dianafalzone -  draconian NDAs forced on employees let go - abomination of so-called brainroom @ Fox b/c they dared to put out real news.

#LiftOurVoices #SpeakUp

So let me try to understand this ... women at Fox News for last 4 yrs bravely come forward & say they were harassed & they're maligned by Fox & now 2 lawsuits against Judge Nap accusing him of lewd sexual acts/abuse & he's still on the air.

WTF
