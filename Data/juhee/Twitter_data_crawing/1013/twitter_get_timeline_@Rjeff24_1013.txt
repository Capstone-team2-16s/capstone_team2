You can root for someone and hate on someone at the same time 🤣😂.. 
it’s like an inside joke for just yourself.
How it started ➡️ How it’s Going 🤣 

Well this sums up the last decade..  
Curious as to thoughts on High School and 18 vs 3 years in college and coming in at 21

Hi Dei 😂🤣

It’s crazy how when Anthony Davis decides he’s going to dominate he’s by the rim and not shooting jumpers! 
The jumpers should be the dessert not the main course. 
He’s always been the key to the Lakers dominance!

Lakers are already scrambling more than they did last game

Ok Skip! 
Please don’t start this, you’re wrong move on. 
You’re off tomorrow so stop trying to create talking points. 
🤣🤬 
Great sign AD is back but if he’s doesn’t get mean and aggressive we might as well just go to Game 6
So much respect here! 
I actually agree 😏
