@realDonaldTrump says at start of rally he is going to kiss all the men in audience
And comes off stage at end dancing to YMCA üòÆ
Now that WOULD be an October surprise

@JoeBiden has said on Monday:
*he is proud to be running for the Senate
*forgot which state he was in (said Pennsylvania; he was in Ohio)
* And forgot Mitt Romney's name
ü§®

He‚Äôs back!

The @realDonaldTrump merch at Sanford Airport doing a good trade, but probably best not to get sticky fingers... 

Dino you said my old school studio in DC made it look like I was announcing a break-in at the Watergate

Ok then.... 

Wow. These are big numbers.... 

Seems the president is going for a tweet marathon this morning. 
Hasn‚Äôt stopped posting in last couple of hours

But he was banned by the administration from appearing on @ABC this morning, when he could have spoken for himself.....ü§î

Small schnauzer world!
Beautiful. 
Thanks re Americast

I'm now wishing the podcast was a hardback book, because this would definitely make the cover: 
'Candour, chemistry and comedy rolled into one'
Thanks Andrew. 
Do I have to share this accolade with @maitlis?

Receiving this has just made me feel incredibly homesick for London and Hampstead Heath. Hiya Alfie...

This is important. 
First major poll since @realDonaldTrump became ill with #Coronavirus  - and shows Biden ahead in Michigan and Nevada and tied in Iowa - but most worrying for White House will be attitudes expressed.....

Words that may come back to haunt @BorisJohnson - Ben Rhodes was deputy National Security Advisor under Obama 

I mean why would you let the public health expert in charge of the fight against the pandemic come on and talk about - err - the fight against the pandemic?

I tell you what, the South Carolina senate race is really one to watch in November. 
Looks like Dem candidate has raised in one quarter more than the total either Labour or Cons spent through whole general election in 2019. 
This in one senate race.


I don‚Äôt think it could happen in UK. 
IMHO parliamentary system provides much more scrutiny. 
We still don‚Äôt know whether President had Covid when he went on stage to debate Biden cos WH won‚Äôt say when he lasted tested negative. 
That‚Äôs inexcusable on every level

Call me sceptical, but this latest statement from @realDonaldTrump physician says  he‚Äôs been ‚Äòfever-free for well over 24 hours.‚Äô 
I thought he‚Äôd been fever free since returning to WH. 
And more importantly, has he tested negative for COVID? 
This doesn‚Äôt say


üò°


Enjoy. Great books...well three of them are....!

Absolutely fair point - in public demonstration there is way more enthusiasm for the president than there is for Joe Biden. 
But it's about what happens at the ballot box - not what happens at rallies and boat parades

Louise...are you trying to kill us!

Exactly. 
One comparison to 2016 and now it is this: in 2016 there were 2 uniquely unpopular candidates and polls were v volatile. 
The remarkable thing about this year is just how consistent they are. 
Doesn't mean they're right. 
But national and state polls do show Biden leading

But every president running for re-election does that. 
You can‚Äôt criticize Donald Trump on that front

The interesting one there is Iowa.
@realDonaldTrump won the state by 10 points in 2016. 
If things were going well, he wouldn‚Äôt be campaigning there with only 3 weeks to go


Many, many congratulations. 
Fabulously well deserved - and please keep up your essential work, which only becomes more important

Very good news....

Statement confirming second #PresidentialDebate  due on 15th is off #Election2020. 
How much money would you bet on the final one taking place a week later?

Really pleased to hear it...hope you‚Äôre enjoying DC
A true gentleman to be with on the road. 
Mr Robbins you will be sorely missed

10 days after confirmation of diagnosis for #coronavirus, @realDonaldTrump‚Å© will be back on the road on Monday....

Love America and best assignment ever reporting on Donald Trump. 
That aside you‚Äôre spot on üôÑ

You clearly haven‚Äôt read the book

Response from UK Department of Health and Social Care after @SpeakerPelosi expresses concern the British have lower standards than #FDA on vaccine approval

1. Not bitter
2. Photographer and film crew were there
3. Head of coast guard was at WH previous Sunday for indoor event for gold star families. 
He then tests positive forcing joint chiefs to self quarantine. 
So linked
#believeinfacts

Thanks for book plug....still available on Amazon

I think they would say here that that would be getting ahead of your skis....

This is bonkers, Paul. 
I got to the White House and saw for first time in ages that marine guard was on duty. 
And posted a picture. 
And because other twitter users make comments, that is my responsibility? 
Do you have any idea how mad this sounds?

So you just can‚Äôt justify the complaint about my tweet, can you?

And you just don‚Äôt have the humility to admit you were wrong to criticise.  
You‚Äôre looking for a definition of contemptuous...

Also if I give you such displeasure just unfollow me. 
It‚Äôs simple

This is absurd. 
You accuse me of anti Trump bias over posting a tweet showing a marine guard outside the West Wing which is totally without comment. 
That‚Äôs it. May I gently suggest the problem is with you, not me. 
You are seeing things not there

I have looked at your tweets, and you bewilder me. Help me understand. 
Show me the error of my ways. 
Tell me anything - I mean anything - biased in the above tweet

You might say that.....
ü§î

Wonder whether he thinks it‚Äôs ‚Äòa blessing from God‚Äô

What you mean reporting what‚Äôs happened?

Interesting. 
The presence of the marine guard outside the West Wing just now means that @realDonaldTrump is working inside the Oval Office

aah the luxury to be able to do that......!

üëèüëèüëè

This is interesting take out from  #VPDebate

Well she was shrply critical over breaking with him on collapsing stimulus talks

Obvious metaphor is rats/sinking ships. 
It's more subtle than that. His prime concern is to keep control of Senate - Trump winning is secondary. 
Seems to me this is @senatemajldr saying to Republicans in tight races if you want to break from Trump and criticise him, you can

This. Is. Exceptional. Unprecedented. 
In essence the normally reliably loyal Republican leader in the Senate @senatemajldr is saying to the president ‚Äòserves you bloody well right‚Äô for catching 
#coronavirus

Woah! This is totally damning from the usually loyal Republican Senate leader, @senatemajldr and will infuriate @realDonaldTrump

Go on, be fly and catch our latest episode

@JoeBiden is in for virtual debate 
#PresidentialDebate

Well maybe there will be NO 2nd presidential debate. Had assumed with Presidential Debates Commission statement they had agreement of both campaigns.... 
#PresidentialDebate

Shall we call it now, and say the likely winner of next week‚Äôs #PresidentialDebate2020 is going to be the mute button?

Just in: 
2nd presidential debate between @JoeBiden and @realDonaldTrump to be virtual and not in person. 
#PresidentialDebate

@KamalaHarris with her Indian and Jamaican heritage looked like she'd been told to go out and play a straight bat to everything. 
Don't try and hit the ball to the boundary. 
Don't swing wildly outside the off stump

If only @VP had done that
#VPDebate2020 
#onthefly

caught on the fly. 
Or fly caught on the Pence

#PenceHarrisDebate

Most exciting thing to happen so far is that @VP seems to have a very black fly stuck in his very white hair 
#BidenHarris2020 
#VPDebate
In the name of....
Please, please #SusanPage say 'but that is not an answer to my question'

Hope you credit...!
üòâ

Does this make me shallow....but given how much there is at stake, I'm thinking this could be, well, a little more engaging, exciting even?

Not like Tottenham at Old Trafford @montie

You get the impression - an unAmerican soccer metaphor - that these are two sides both happy to settle for a 0-0 draw. 
Both circling each other warily. 
Don't want to run down the field and try to score a goal in case they are hit on the counter attack
#VPDebate

Has either person actually answered a question they've been asked yet? 
And has moderator yet said - 'interesting, but that's not what I asked'
#VPDebate

didn't want to introduce this hashtag this soon, but 
#Susangetagrip 
#VPDebate
Susan...get a grip. 
Please
#VPDebate
wow....

In normal circumstances this #VPDebate2020  between @KamalaHarris and @VP would have all the excitement of the World Cup match played between the two losing semi-finalists for third place...but not this election season

Right. enough chat. 
Let's get on with it
#VPDebate2020

‚ÄòA blessing from God‚Äô says the president on catching #coronavirus - which has so far killed 210k Americans. 
He says he now knows how fantastic the drug treatments are, and says every American will get same Regeneron drugs as he did for free. 
Tho doesn‚Äôt say how that will work

Clever...

Lot of tweets like this so far today. 
And last night

That‚Äôs reassuring cos they‚Äôve worked so well until now....


Always have done. 
We presented together years ago. 
Also her twitter handle is @maitlis

no, thank you Ian...
Well I hadn‚Äôt seen that coming....that‚Äôs British irony, btw

This is important. 
Key Dem advisor to Biden told me a couple of months back that overriding strategic goal of campaign is to keep him #Covid free. 
And given current polls, does he need to take risks?

BREAKING: 
Add to that @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs most senior advisor and his speechwriter Stephen Miller has contracted 
#coronavirus

Latest on @WhiteHouse #COVID19 outbreak - more of press team have tested positive. 
@ABC reporting military aide who carries nuclear football has it too. 
And virtually every senior military officer is quarantining after an admiral tested positive - he was at WH event last Sunday

üôè

Definitely the former, with maybe a soup√ßon of the latter...

Emily. 
Great pleasure. 
How you doing?!

Dear brave person who won‚Äôt use a real name, 
It was a joke. 
üôÑ

They‚Äôre pretty annoyed about the White House becoming a Covid hot-spot

Sparrow wars by our @WhiteHouse live position fighting over best spot for a dust-bath

I‚Äôm sure you already have, but if you haven‚Äôt (and if you haven‚Äôt, why not?!) do subscribe to  #Americast with @maitlis and @awzurcher

Amen to that....

Wonder whether @JoeBiden will now be the one demanding a drugs test. 
After course of Dexamethasone, the president‚Äôs probably got more steroids in him than an East German shot-putter...

The last five days in 20 seconds. Genius... 

üòâ
I‚Äôve always wanted to do Soccer Saturday. I think Maitlis and me could nail that 

This is quite a read.... 

Our podcast recorded as @realDonaldTrump left #WalterReedMedicalCenter to return to the White House

'I stood out front, I led. 
Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did. 
I know there's a risk, there's a danger but that's ok.'  
You bet this is his closing argument for the #Election2020

Really?? you sure Nick?? 
Only bad refereeing decisions going against Spurs make me angry

When @realDonaldTrump tweeted don't let #COVID__19 dominate your lives, I guess this is what he meant....

Our reporting tonight on @realDonaldTrump returning to White House and latest on his treatment

Steady. Praise like that will go to my head....
Which sort of raises the question - why was he moved to #WalterReed?

Am sure it's pure coincidence, but 6.30 is when the three nightly news shows  from the networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - go on air

A fair point....

Don‚Äôt be afraid of #COVID19 says the president, even though it has killed over 200,000 Americans so far 

Breaking: 
@realDonaldTrump says he‚Äôll be returning this evening to White House


physician #SeanConley due to brief on @realDonaldTrump condition at top of next hour - 15.00EST, 20.00BST

Thank you. Kind of you to say

It is astonishing to say, but the @WhiteHouse is now the epicentre of a major #covid outbreak, begging so many questions about their protocols and safety measures. 
Kayleigh briefed reporters - as recently as yesterday - without a mask

BREAKING: 
president's press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, has tested positive for #Coronavirus. 
She briefed us on Thursday without a mask - and again without a mask on Friday following the president's diagnosis
