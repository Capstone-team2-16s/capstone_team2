every now and then I catch my siblings listening to some of my songs and it makes me really happy... 
It's never the "Popular" songs but the ones they know the back story to & mean a lot to me.. ❤️

Oh and buenos dias!

Just sat down with a class in Chicago via Video. I have to say that it feels so good to connect with our youth. 
We are capable of so much good & great change. 
That was a beautiful way to start my morning. 
Thankful for honest conversations. ❤️
