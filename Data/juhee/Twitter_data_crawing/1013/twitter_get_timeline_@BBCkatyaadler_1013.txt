Lessons from 2016 when ‘populist’ parties took centre stage largely bc voters felt complacent traditional politicians weren’t listening to their concerns. Many traditional parties have since adopted ‘populist’ elements. 
Always hard to generalise but there are patterns we can see

That scandal of course is peculiar to the FPÖ but you’ll notice across Europe that more extreme parties have generally not made political hay despite national governments everywhere struggling with Covid. 
Also it’s true across much of Europe that mainstream parties have ‘learned’

borrowed themes from the far right/nationalist right, like being tough on immigration (see Austria’s PP in government). 
More extreme parties are also losing support in number of European countries because faced with a pandemic, many voters say feel safer w traditional parties

After receiving a massive slap in the face in Vienna’s municipal elections yesterday, Austria’s far right Freedom Party plans to take a good look at itself👇
As in the NL, many voters in Austria who’d flirted with the far right are now turning to centre right parties that have

Domestic necessities are sucking up leaders time/attention eg Boris Johnson’s big statement today; 
Macron’s expected on Weds.This when political leaders do need to lend attention to Brexit to approve uncomfortable compromises neededboth sides of Channel if deal is to be reached

As predicted early in negotiations, the risk UK and EU took in leaving the big issues till the last moment this autumn (and of course each side blames the other for doing that) is that #COVID19 is back with a vengeance


If that is agreed, EU thinking is that its coastal states will compromise considerably on fish. 
This won’t all happen this week clearly. 
EU expectation is IF deal emerges, it’ll be (mid, even late) November

n state aid, environment, labour regulations etc. Brussels also insisting on robust dispute mechanism (esp after Internal Mkt Bill surprise) to take swift, weighty legal action if treaty terms breached by either side

for the U.K. getting zero tariff zero quota access to the single market. 
NB While most in EU recognise the U.K. post Brexit can’t/won’t sign up to Brussels rules in perpetuity the EU will insist on at least signing up to mutually agreed norms/principles

EU expectation is that France will play hardball as it did in Brexit divorce negotiations last year. But France is not only fishing state afraid of losing quotas in UK waters. 
France also not alone in worrying about what EU sees as ‘fair competition’ rules in exchange

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will brief Europe Ministers of the 27 member states (or as many of them as attend tomorrow’s General Affairs Council). 
This ahead of the EU leaders summit in Brussels this Thurs and Friday where #Brexit will be discussed amongst others topics 

Clearly no Brexit trade deal ready by 15 Oct as the PM has wanted BUT talks continue apace. 
This week in Brussels (Monday to Wednesday) focussing on fish and level playing field (including governance) in particular

Berlin #coronavirus restrictions 👇 https://t.co/9pgfsdsalA

Angela Merkel has warned that Germans will face tighter corona restrictions in 10 days if a rise in infections isn’t stopped. 
Mrs Merkel held an online conference with the leaders of 11 German cities to discuss a sharp increase in case numbers #coronavirus

Germany’s Health Minister describes rising infection rates as “alarming”/“worrying”👇
German health officials have warned #coronavirus second wave could be more severe than the one in the spring.

The Spanish government has declared a “state of alarm” (as it’s known in the Spanish constitution) in Madrid. 
This, to force through #coronavirus measures that Madrid’s regional government had rejected..👇

Including the central and Eastern Europeans. Macron described to me as divisive figure in EU and as being “up a tree over Brexit”. 
We can’t forget Macron is also in election mode ahead of next French presidential vote and wants to be seen as protecting French interests

Of course everyone EU-side recognises challenges of Covid and economic consequences but.. I’ve heard predictions of a Johnson-Merkel meeting or at least ‘high profile phone chat’. 
Germany has rotating presidency of EU. Merkel also seen as able to bring EU centre around her

But EU coastal nations will only move (and yes, reluctantly so) when they see the UK has moved too over other issues. 
It’s seen as important in EU that Boris Johnson now in contact with EU Commission Pres von der Leyen. 
“He’s left it lamentably late to get involved” is EU view

Won’t move from their fishing rights claims till see UK concessions over governance and LPF. 
But I disagree with recent reports saying EU coastal nations have toughened their stance against concessions over fish, full stop. 
EU won’t let this deal die over fish

Compromising over governance and level playing field UNLESS it can clearly see the EU will make key concessions over fish. 
And here we’re stuck in #Brexit chicken and egg AGAIN. 
While UK won’t move fully on LPF and governance till fish compromise is clear, EU coastal countries

his could be to distract public from concessions UK is preparing to make over governance and level playing field in the knowledge that the EU will make concessions for the UK over fish but EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has also recognised the UK will have difficulty

Of big three remaining issues EU wants to leave fish till last. 
First governance, then level playing field, then fish BUT there’s dawning recognition that won’t work for UK. 
David Frost has been sounding a loud warning over fish 

But it’s far, far from straightforward. Is there enough time for agreement? 
One high level diplomat suggested to me maybe both sides need a few months of no deal to clear their heads and get them to finish the deal in 2021. 
No-one in the EU thinks a deal possible in October


UK rejects ECJ involvement. 
EU accepts that. EU says can’t go through UK courts bc they follow domestic legislation. 
Both sides could found a stand alone court for this deal but that means agreeing norms bilaterally..
Maybe have a bilateral arbitration panel? 
It’s not insoluble

Problem is: what should that governance look like? This conundrum means we could be so very very very near to a deal (because fish can definitely be resolved. 
See below) and yet still fail to get one by end of transition. 
Governance conundrum: 

While this means the issue of level playing field is en route to possibly being worked out via robust governance mechanism ie UK sovereignty *protected* by not having to sign up to agreed rules on state aid etc while EU single market is protected via a tough dispute mechanism..

It’s seen as v positive in EU that UK chief negotiator David Frost yesterday spoke of this dispute mechanism also working in UKs favour. 
EU sees that as sign of UK ´coming round’ BUT

In a deal with UK and that if UK businesses suddenly get an unfair competitive advantage bc spending less on environmental regulations or receiving more in state aid, then EU wants to be able to take speedy action via dispute mechanism.

U keener on this than ever in a deal with UK following the government threat to override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement with its internal market bill. 
EU leaders say they need to justify an eventual deal to their voters. 
Proof haven’t sold out French/Dutch/German interests

While UK side keeps *banging on* about fish fish fish .. the Brussels end of post #Brexit trade negotiations now *harps on* (AND ON) about governance ie need for a robust dispute mechanism with teeth allowing for swift legal action (including suspending chunks of whole deal)

Blimey 


Of course we’re not there yet and don’t be surprised if the EU-UK mood music becomes more ominous again as this month progresses but the general sense (hope) in EU circles is that a deal can/will be struck in November

Usual caveats: 
nothing is certain etc and what UK/EU say in public may not match 100% what’s happening in closed talks but hearing David Frost talk about common principles on state aid and need for UK too of a robust dispute mechanism in EU-UK deal will be music to EU ears

From Downing Street statements following PMs call today with EU Chief negotiator Michel Barnier plus statements by Michael Gove and the UKs chief negotiator David Frost to the House of Lords EU Committee it is clear the government is in deal mode and sees progress in EU talks

“The Prime Minister reiterated that any deal must reflect what the British people voted for and that businesses and citizens needed certainty very soon on the terms of our future relationship. They agreed to remain in touch on this issue.” 

« Although some progress had been made in recent discussions, they acknowledged that significant areas of difference remain, particularly on fisheries. 
Chief Negotiators should continue to work intensively in the coming days to try to bridge the gaps. »

But « He also underlined the UK was prepared to end the transition period on Australia-style terms if an agreement could not be found. 
» ie no trade deal 

Re cal’ today between PM and EU Chief negotiator Michel Barnier, a 
Downing Street spokesperson said:
« The Prime Minister outlined our clear commitment to trying to reach an agreement, underlining that a deal was better for both sides. »
