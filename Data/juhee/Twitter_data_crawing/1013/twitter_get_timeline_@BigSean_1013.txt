Yessir! It takes 4-6 weeks (says that on the site too). To press up n make fresh. 
I definitely wanted it to be done that way as opposed to just sitting around prior. 
It feels better and it’s cleaner n safer when it’s made 4 you, pressed up n shipped directly to you! 
More time tho

On God 🤞🏾
I hope this not real
