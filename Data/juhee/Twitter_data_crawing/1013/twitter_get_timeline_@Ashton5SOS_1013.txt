Let it light a path of self love, strength and a deeper understanding of being kind to yourself! Love this ink. 
I drew this for the same reasons you’ve got it tattooed.

Incredibly cool.

The story of the “Superbloom” album cover.

Don’t worry. 
Me too 😂🥺🙏❤️

One day audiences will return, one-day we will all feel that heavenly rush of sound boom through those speakers and we will unify to celebrate songs together. 
Until then, it’s just me and the house plants 🌱 

Yes! I just have a distribution label working with me 🙌🏻💗

Well just so you know, since my music is independent, I really appreciate you and am so grateful for you sharing it. 
It’s the best!! 
Thank you 🙏 💚
