The governor of my state of birth is a true BOSS. 
Watching her comment on the sick domestic terrorism threat she and her family faces is soul-stirring. 
Bravo @GovWhitmer

Brilliant😂

Lol, yes

What in the name of whatever power one may worship will give us a moderator for one of these important debates that isn’t absolutely beyond awful?
Amen
Lol
Al Freeman Jr. for the win. Always.
Yup
Yup
True. 
I wish she would though.

She missed a home run on that packing the courts moment. 
Didn’t bring up McConell and them blocking Garland. 
She wound up and checked her swing. 
SWEEP THE LEG.
🙏
Amen
Yup
Shameful
For real
For real
She’s terrible
😂😂😂 yes.
Lol
Amen. 
So tired of that
Sweep the leg dammit

Biden is NOT up by 11 points in Florida. 
That is total bs. VOTE
May the judgment heaped on evil voter supressionists be swift, damning, unrelenting, and eternal. 
Nice list.
Lol
Yup. Most definitely.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Absolutely.
Enough said.
This is the truth. 
These large digit polls mean absolutely nothing. 
They know they can’t win unless they cheat, so they are doing just that. 
And doing very well at it. 
There is too much going on behind the scenes, and evil and indecency is their specialty.

I like that quick cough he tried to suppress in there too during that pose.
He snuck a quick cough in there too and tried to suppress it
In other news, because there is other news: another tragedy.

Watching @DeadlineWH on @MSNBC and they just called the folks “The Larry, Mo, and Curly of White House Communications” 😂😂😂 @clairecmc the win and my heart, always. 
I adore you. 
You rock

Hollywood.

And yet we are told “Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life.”  209,690 lives lost. 
Infections increase by the minute, but, you know. 209,690 and counting.

Wild
Indeed
It’s mind-boggling
This is unreal.
This thread. The struggle is real.
Disgusting
