Honestly - can our KIDS JUST GO TO SCHOOL????? 
I think this is the most personal I’ve gotten in an interview. 
@adamcarolla and I “went there” ... and then some. Appreciated the great talk.
-Comm’n on Pres. Debates really botched this. 
Had no right to unilaterally change debate to virtual. 
Should try hard to resurrect in-person debate.
-Also: if Trump is COVID-free, we need to hear it from someone other than Conley, who lied to us repeatedly.
Kids are sitting at home not able to go to school for others’ protection and ... this.
  Sick of this B.S. 
Oh sweetheart, you should unfollow me bc I have a lot to say.
Happy Columbus Day!
“Columbus Day is a time to remember that that which seems impossible rarely is. 
It is a day to...ask yourself what challenges you can face with strength and purpose.”
No they aren’t. 
Football and baseball have done just fine. 
Why don’t you take a look at what Adam Silver just said about political messages in the NBA before you try to lecture others.
So many ppl feel this way. 
They got political and the fans left in droves. 

How do you look this good at 37 weeks?
You look amazing!!

Also thx to the media which pours gasoline on any and every spark he ignites - no matter how big or small, all are treated like a 5-alarm fire.
Well said @JoeConchaTV
I interviewed @RealCandaceO for a wide-ranging interview on President Trump and how she came to support him, victimhood, racism in America, motherhood & more.
Listen, download, subscribe & review here:
They can’t possibly go with this. 
How stupid do they think we are? 
This is insane. 
This cannot suffice.

Just dropped our latest episode of the @MegynKellyShow  - post VP debate analysis with @charlescwcooke, @krystalball, & @esaagar -check it out!

It’s not my job to “support” her, &amp; it’s not sexist to critique her.

He wasn’t demeaning her. 
He was making a point on policy.
Monster?
Is he *trying* to lose? 

How dare you compare my tweet, suggesting Kamala woman-up (meaning be her strongest, composed self) make less faces while Pence is speaking to a man who sexually abused, harassed & hurt so many women?

Ppl have lost their minds. 
I address on my podcast dropping later today.
Yes.
Sure, b/c absolutely no one criticized Trump for his behavior at the last debate. 
Commission on Pres. 
Debates announces (unilaterally, apparently) that next debate will be VIRTUAL. 
Trump: “Pathetic,” and NO. 
We won’t attend.
It’s there now!

Download “The Megyn Kelly Show” on your podcast app and hear my full reaction along w/ analysis from my panel tomorrow!
Holy Lord. 

Maddow: 
“Pence tried to steamroll Harris and the moderator and instead he looked (again) flaccid” ... 
N Wallace: “he looked limp and lame.” 
Steamroll? Limp & lame? 
Good Lord the hatred is overwhelming.

Nicole Wallace: 
“VP Pence appeared flaccid.”
 Omg I’m done.
Joy Reid saying Mike Pence interrupted continually and every woman knows what it is like to have that happen over and over - 
she was “momala” in that woman and it was very bad for Donald Trump.

Gayle King: 
“it was very telling that a fly landed on Mike Pence’s head when he was denying America’s systemic racism. 
The fly was like ‘say whaaat?’” 😳
Is anyone else wondering why we haven’t seen Pence more in this campaign?
Very nice answer by Pence to Brecklyn on Ginsburg &amp; Scalia and how “America always comes together.” 
Answer of the night.
Pence: 
“I think we’re going to win this election.”
Harris: 
“VOTE. Pls vote.”
Pence: 
“When Joe Biden was VP, the FBI actually spied on our campaign”
The fly is free and now getting a COVID test
Omg Susan Page needs to tell him
#flygate!
Does he have a fly on his head??
Pence: 
“Biden’s belief that law enforcement have an implicit bias against minorities is a great insult.”
Pence: 
“I trust our justice system.”
She won’t answer. 
Re court packing. Good on Pence for pointing it out.
The “I’m speaking, *I’m* speaking” thing worked at first. 
Now it’s getting old.
Pence: 
“The American ppl deserve an answer: are you and Biden going to pack the Supreme Court?”
No
Harris: 
“Biden and I are ppl of faith and it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith.” 
Media/Dems... ummm ... 
she doesn’t speak for us Handmaiden!

Pence on Amy Coney Barrett’s Catholicism: 
Don’t go there.
Pence: 
“Joe Biden opposes the raid on Osama Bin Laden!”
Pence: 
“these slanders are absurd.”
This is Harris at her strongest. 
(Re Trump and military)
Pence: 
“we destroyed the ISIS caliphate.”
Harris making the Iran deal sound like a fun campfire w/s’mores we were all enjoying until evil orange man ruined it.
Harris: 
“Trump has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world” 
Here we go on For Policy...
“There’s a weird obsession that Trump has had with getting rid of anything accomplished by Obama” FACT.
Is anyone else starting to fade?
This is so calm, soothing. 
The Smooth Jazz debate.  
Not like the “Get Off My Lawn” 
Debate last week.
China! Drink!
Pence: 
“lost the trade war with China?? 
Joe Biden never fought it.” 
Good counterpoint.
Harris: 
“you lost that trade war (with China). 
You lost.” 
Strong, simple. Check.

Instead of “like a man.” We can be stoic too
Take it like a woman. 
Don’t make faces.
Omg the head shake.
So far Susan Page doing a nice job.
Ok Karen. 
“Reigned over?”
Don’t smirk. 
Don’t shake your head. 
Don’t smile mockingly. Wait.

“There was a time when our country believed in science.” 
(Was it the time they said Covid would skip the BLM protesters?)

Pence projects “gentleman.” 
Tough to dislike. 
So far Kamala looks professional, calm. 
Should stop the head shaking.
Pence: same!
Page: have you and Biden had The Incapacitation Talk? 
Harris: dodges: 
I was the first female DA in my district and getting chosen as VP nom was wonderful.
Pence: 
“Stop playing politics with ppl’s lives -your continued undermining of confidence in a vaccine is unacceptable.”
Harris with good rebuttal - you failed to provide them with the truth to make those decisions
Pence: 
“We trust the American ppl to make choices about their health. 
We are about freedom.”
Pence is so much better than Trump at defending Trump
The plan is contact tracing?
This literally made me lol
Looking forward to this! 
See you in a few @scrowder!
Looking forward to it!

I don’t think media should be circulating the Claudia Conway postings. 
The family is obviously struggling w/a tough… 

I’ve tweeted about my friend @JoelleCosentino &amp; her amazing dance company thru which she was training &amp; empowering… 

Woah. 


nails it.

That “idea” has hurt and killed a lot of people.
