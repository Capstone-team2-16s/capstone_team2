Thank you!

You are a SURVIVOR. 
And there is an army of women and men who do support you. 
Forget the name callers and hold your head high. You got this.

Great article and perspective from my friend who worked in the White House with President Reagan -- and how he feels for the workers there now in the #COVID__19 world. 


Excited to contribute and help answer @TheWeek’s big question alongside @annehelen @gracyolmstead and 
@CynthiaGreenlee

Palm Beach Gardens Fire Rescue Station 65 was manned by a shift made up of all women for the first time in the history of the department, since it was founded in 1963.

Never happens to men — just ALL female candidates. 
This is apolotical folks. Pls stop! 
#WeHaveHerBack 
and now the President saying he won't do the 2nd debate virtually. 
that's because you can actually be muted on zoom. 
#PresidentialDebate2020

haha
NDAs are the kiss of death for people in ANY workplace because you can never say what happened to you if the environment turns toxic. 
It's why we're working to eradicate them @LiftOurVoicesUS-- join us! 

this changes A LOT

Well this changes a lot. 
Next Presidential debate will be VIRTUAL. 
I've always said much more tough for nterruptus to take place when Biden & Trump won't be on the same LIVE stage together. 
Much easier to cut off mics & video. 
It's called MUTE. 
#PresidentialDebate2020

Oh wow what a new sexist approach
Thanks for the levity ..... 
never

Please dear God ask the question tonight about VP Mike Pence claiming men shouldn't go to business dinners anymore with women b/c of they just might not be able to control themselves. Please dear God ask this.

It’s debate night! 
What better time to say — Sexist media coverage of all women candidates has no place in 2020. 
We need to put all journalists on notice (& I can say it as part of that group!)

Always the highlight of my day!! 
@RandyRainbow is brilliant! 

It was time!

And 4 years and 3 months to the day since my story about suing Roger Ailes at Fox News came to light. 
Courage is contagious. 
Let’s keep this cultural revolution moving  and stop silencing women too with NDAs.

Why are we ok with treating female candidates like this from either party? 
Come on — we are better than this and we have all backs.

I need this today .... 

The most popular Democrat @MichelleObama comes out swinging with a closing argument for @JoeBiden 

I just can’t
