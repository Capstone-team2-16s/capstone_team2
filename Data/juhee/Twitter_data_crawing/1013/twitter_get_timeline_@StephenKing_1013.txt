She's "upset" and "concerned." 
It's what she does. 
Me and an evil sidekick. 
Thanks, Funko!
They need a new sheriff. The old ones keep dying. 
Yup. No doubt.
Flashbacks: The narrative version of meat extender.
3 more things to know about TO THE LAKE:
1. Think spaghetti western, only with snow and plague-infested killer Russians.
2. The cinematography is cool. 
Some stuff is filmed upside-down. 
Why? Dunno.

I went to the movies last night.

Hey hey, ho ho,

Susan Collins has to go.

She has willingly voted for Trump-nominated judges as incompetent as Trump is himself.

Collins supporters have lied about Gideon and tarred her with every brush they can get their hands on.
No.
THE LORD OF THE FLIES, starring Mike Pence! 
Coming soon to a streaming platform near you.
Hey waiter!

Mike Pence will have some shit for his fly.
The fly knows.
Play it. Sing it. Share it.
