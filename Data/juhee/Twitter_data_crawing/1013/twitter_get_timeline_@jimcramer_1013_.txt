Nice work!

i love Italian suits and while some here criticize me i would rather buy nice clothes than waste the money on food and drink...
completely untrue. 
does that bother you at all? 

thanks boss! 
thank you! 
the relentless nature of those who want to call you out for being wrong when you are not is a little overwhelming. 
You have enough of that at home and you love your family!
debating writing my https://t.co/2Cj9QmVLog speech for Wednesday morning now. 
EXCEPT every time i have done that it has been a mistake!  
Have to wait to get closer
these are gracious words and i am humbled.. thank you

Watch and Wait on Plug Power Before Buying: 

there's just so damn many of them simply because they know i read my feed. 
Easier to get someone to read it for me and tweet it for me but the real people deserve a real person

Happy Thanksgiving Day Canada!!!!
what others besides JAG?

Not easy. 
People would argue here about the name of my mother

it is unfortunate that there are so many combative people who have not worked as hard as i have and don't have wisdom from 1979.

Do you even know who Frank Slootman is? 

future sales--yet your facts straight..., 




see i love this. 
I live alone during the week and do not go out during the pandemic... 

of course the real issue is that, bizarrely, my doubters/foes follow me closely and know i read the tweets even with the volume i have so they want to hurt me or get me fired or whatever. 
All you can do is outlast them.
I absolutely love the garden suggestions. 
Those are pure fun. 
Query: how long do you put the Christmas red peppers in the vodka before it is ready?
It's at its best when you can learn. 
It's at its worst when you try to make the kind of fun i did wearing a suit to garden and people actually think i wear a suit. 
Stunts do not work. 
Alas too many have a bone to pick
things to realize about Twitter: 
it is occasionally okay to joke around .and to be ironic and tongue-in-cheek...
Jimmy Chill was just having some fun. 
@davidfaber was joking about how he never sees me in anything but a suit!  
It was a stunt!!!
@Wendys consolation for @Eagles loss 
I feel best when i wear a suit to whatever i am doing... 
Just feels comfy.. 
Brioni makes them perfect for weeding..
if Jake had hit that field goal...i could be Jimmy Chill instead of Jimmy I’ll

Here's real life: 
on Thursday i would love to have one of our great dishes from Bar San Miguel. 
Instead i am eating a Chipotle bowl.
exactly exactly right. 
I would NEVER exchange my Jersey shore pizza for Dominos. 
However, in Summit i am a very happy Domino's user.
Same, by the way, when i am in Mexico!

this sounds like the best of the lot 
Jimmy Chill begs to disagree. 
In fact the tomato pie is among the best  i have ever had

After the Pomp broadcast i bought some Bitcoin for my kids as i said i would! 

We’re giving out a million dollars to the best mask design, and young innovators from around the world answered the call!

Counting down the top 25... 
😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷

Jimmy Chill notes that while i am a writer for thestreet, we sold the company and this isn't mine. Being futher left? 
Chill says are you aware that the left took me apart less than two weeks ago?

When the @Eagles are at the Super Bowl i will be sure to check em out

Should Dominos really be down? 
Watch tonight 

The aggressive Fastly buyers are revealed as being morons even as i still like the stock

It's fluid--if Roche pitches in to Regeneron totally different numbers. 
stay focused 
Come on, who is chasing this Fastly? 
Why? is it a toy?
is anything a sprint and not a marathon??

i am a devoting  a ridiculous amount of time trying to stay ahead of this.. thank you so much! 

i got my usual huge blowback that i put up with so i can help you make money 

Jimmy Chill says that seven people did die in Taiwan since the pandemic and they all wear masks so maybe masks don't work. 
Or maybe you are as obtuse as the warden in Shawshank

use portion control

you are cadre! 



On Regeneron. 
I know many will want to buy the stock today because of the president's comments. 
I want you to be aware that we have repeatedly told people to buy it. 
Nothing revelatory.

😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷
😷😷😷😷😷😷
😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷 

go get em Pops!

i agree with Dr. Wachter. 
The President doesn't look like a man who just battled covid-19 and i know the Regeneron drug is the real deal first 200,000 on the house. 
Doc, it's the aerosol factor that made me mothball my restaurant. 
Until they figure it out and i know how to run my air conditioning, i am too concerned to stay open

I need a Lilly floater

Look, at this point in my life, if i can do nice things like that it makes the show worth it. 
Thank youl... 

While i don't think Regeneron-the company, not the medicine--thought it had a miracle drug it does seem to have worked wonders as the company promised

We were running out of time, it got a little crazy... 

Gimme a six pack of Regeneron to go
Looks like the president did not get the placebo...

the government will take control of the first couple of hundred thousand .. 
i have said since the beginning that Regeneron is going to beat this thing. 
I just never thought the president would get so behind it. 
They told me they would beat this thing on MARCH 17!!!!

Did the president take his Regeneron price target up? or did he did just recommend taking the stock.
They gave me the Regeneron!!! 
i love it. 
you cannot beat this as an ad for an amazing stock, $REGN!  
(that was the president's statement)
A mask you can drink in??? 
I love seeing these designs from around the world! 


i don't name a dog of mine after a loser stock... even if i lost my poor dog.. a rescue mutt with real game

@Eagles: 
please tell us if DJAX or Alshon are getting ready to play this weekend? 
Huge for us if true!
anyone back who didn't play last week? 

If you trade off of old Fed minutes you are crazy.
thank you!!! 


I had Paychex on last night, the largest payroll processor for small and medium sized businesses in the country. 
They said that Florida was the srongest state in the union for them,

small business en fuego as per Paychex 

of course they did, but small and medium sized business formation is very strong and that is who is supposed to be helped by stimulus

technicians needed in the HOUSE
Florida--very strong why would those two GOP Senators vote for stimulus
been there tried that

Jimmy Chill says many believe V recovery-and there is one in some states. not in others.
that's why we need targeted help. 
Do not forget that many states are out of money

Rittenhouse Square Pietro's versus the one on South Street (where i think you were) may not be good as the real South Street Pietro's pizza. 
I am bought & paid for but still know Philly Pizza and i get that one when i stay at the Rittenhouse. 
TraderTraitor Jim

no contact tracing at White House,. 
Are these people truly setting any example for us?  
NO TRACING is insane. 
It's the type of thing that would make me want to sell this if it were some sort of stock. 
They don't want to know? 
This is not GOP nor Dem it's health

i have banged this drum endlessly and will do so again, 

wow! thanks so much ! 
they all have and should work!!
Actually i have been inputting for about 40 minutes and nothing i write has come up! 

In the end, it seems like the cases for the cities and states were simply not made well. 
I also think that they didn't understand small business because it's hard and expensive to mothball. 
We will rise up but it costs more the longer we wait. 
Powell knew this

I just woke up and still no stimulus
