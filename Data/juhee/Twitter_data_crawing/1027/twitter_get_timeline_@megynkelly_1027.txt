Democrat golden-boy, LA Mayor @ericgarcetti, accused of willingly, repeatedly ignoring his top aide’s alleged bullying, abuse & harassment of multiple staffers, male & female.
@yashar: Garcetti openly laughed at the abuse. Story wld be everywhere if it were re: a GOP rising star.
CONGRATULATIONS!! So happy for you all. 
CA Gov’s Thxgiving insanity:
-Must be held *OUTSIDE*;
-Guests may use bathrm inside if sanitized;
-Masks on while not eating;
-Singing “strongly discouraged;”
-Max of two hours together;
-6 feet *mandated* in all directions b/twn all at table & otherwise.
I’ve been making this point on my podcast: the RCP avg of polls in virtually every swing state shows Biden up over Trump by a margin SMALLER THAN Hillary’s at this exact point in her race vs. Trump. 
And we all know how that worked out.
Also, consider whether losing this person is actually a bad thing. 
If someone de-friends you bc of your politics, was this really a person worth having in your life? 
My friends are Ds, Rs and Is & the ones for whom politics is a deal-breaker quickly & happily get weeded out. 💕

Hot off the presses!
Hey - it worked for Toobin!
That would be awesome if it had any semblance of cleverness. Alas...
Annette my dear, that doesn’t work when you follow me! 
Come on now, do better.
Should prob unfollow me my dear.
Aww, sweetheart, that doesn’t work when you follow me. 
Better luck next time.
Btw, “pulling a Toobin” must become a thing. 
No one should ever have to find another euphemism for said act. 
This is absurd. I read all of the coverage yesterday thinking he was seen on cam pulling a Toobin. 
Now having watched it, it really does appear as if he was tucking in his shirt as he said. 
I get that many don’t like him-but this B.S. is just wrong.
“Laptop from hell”
MSNBC’s Joy Reid saying only time “pigs in a blanket,” etc has ever been chanted by BLM was at a protest 1x in NY &amp; not by BLM proper. 
That is a(nother) lie (below just one example of BLM *admitting* it).
 Oh & has anyone seen ⁦
@Kaepernick7
⁩’s socks?
Nah, just don’t suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome and can still engage in fair analysis. You wouldn’t understand.
MSNBC saying “an avalanche of lying” from DT. 
Now talking about when Maddow cried about what’s happening at the border.
Let’s hope!! 
Trump won this debate, handily. Biden wasn’t a force at all. 
Trump was substantive, on-point, well-tempered. 
Definitely helped himself, when it mattered most.
Biden has definitely said he will ban new fracking on federal lands.
This. ⬇️ https://t.co/KyptY0x6DL
Climate change. Again.
DT: “I’m the least racist person in this room.”
DT: first time I ever heard of BLM,  they were chanting “pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em like bacon.”
Biden going with Russian disinfo! 
After DNI explicitly said the laptop is NOTHING OF THE KIND.
Did Trump just say “laptop from hell”??
Biden: character is on the ballot.
Strong moment: DT: “I ran bc of you!”
Biden was ready on this exchange re: prison reform.
Trump not taking the bait on “systemically racist country” - touts record on prison reform.
Biden: “the fact of the matter is: there is institutionalized racism in America.”
DT: he’s been in gov’t 47 years, he never did a thing but label some “super predators.”
DT: “They don’t come back to the [immig] courts - only those with the lowest IQ.”
DT: “he had 8 years to fix it; he did nothing but build cages. 
He did nothing.”
Trump: “who built the cages Joe?”
“Do you have a plan to unite the kids at the border?” 
“We’re working on it very hard.”
Very very strong DT on minimum wage and leaving it to states.
Biden cribbing Obama: “i don’t see red states or blue states.”
“Billions and billions!” Drink!
Trump should have brought this version of himself to Debate #1 and insisted on a Debate #2 channeling this version. 
His poll numbers are going to go up.
Biden’s fave debate response: “Come on.”
Biden re Trump: “he’s a very confused guy. He thinks he’s running against someone else.”
Trump to @kwelkernbc “so far I do respect very much the way you’re handling this.”
Biden: “where’s the plan??” on covering pre-existing conditions if Obamacare goes down. Fair Q.
Is Joe Biden still here?
Trump saw something that made him believe the interrupting version of him did not go over well with required core voting groups.
DT w/the tell-it-like-it-is moment: he pivots off of China and looks at the audience. 
Typical politician. 
I’m not one. 
That’s why I won.
Trump disciplined- staying on Hunter, the emails, Joe’s alleged cut, etc.
These are empty calories without follow ups and a chance for them to really go back and forth. 
Box them in and make them stay on point.
I’m sorry but 30 secs on the Hunter allegations is a joke.
Not heard from Biden: those emails are fake. 
The laptop isn’t Hunter’s.
Ugh! That’s it??? A total pass!
Biden: “my son has not made money in terms of China.” 
How about Ukraine?
Yes! @kwelkernbc asking Biden about Hunter!! 
Good for her.
Biden: “show us [your taxes], just show us, stop playing around.”
DT: “you made 3.5m from China man, what’s that all about?”
Why is DT answering Biden on taxes (defense) rather than staying on Biden on offense?
Biden: “release your tax returns or stop talking about corruption!”
Biden: “I haven’t taken a penny from any country ever.”
DT: “you were getting a lot of money from Russia! 
You and your family... you owe an explanation to the American ppl... maybe right now.”
Trump’s control here shows his interruptions/aggression in first debate was a strategy. 
He can control himself just fine.
Biden re Rudy: “well, I shouldn’t... well, I will!” Behind these scenes, Biden’s ppl: NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yes! Let them debate/engage!
Trump is winning so far.
So far @kwelkernbc doing a nice job.
DT: “NY is a ghost town... putting up plexiglass is not the answer.  NY is dying.” DEPRESSING &amp; SAD, BUT TRUE.
Trump: “we have to open our country - the cure cannot be worse than the disease.”
DT: “I take full responsibility. But it’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault.”
DT: “Joe has a thing about basements!” - even Biden seemed to chuckle.
Biden denying calling Trump xenophobic *bc of travel ban* from China. 
So he just happened to drop that term re Trump within hours of the ban being announced?
Trump a lot more controlled, subdued tonight. More disciplined.
Welker: some say we will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. 2022??
Biden says Trump is “responsible for” the 220k+ dead from COVID. 
Do Americans really believe that? 
That it’s Trump’s fault?
Trump on COVID “I can tell you from personal experience” re what some say is a cure. Lemonade out of lemons!
Smug smile from Biden on “mics will be turned off” during other man’s 1st answer.
No family member or other person has “held stock for [Joe Biden].” 
Well, now, that doesn’t quite answer the Q, does it? 
Did Hunter collect $$ meant for dad? 
Strike a deal to do so?
That they may not have been “in business” together (as claimed below) d/n answer these Qs at all.
You guys look great! Lots of love!
Omg is he *always* a jerk?
“It’s extremely hard for me to watch him lie through his teeth and get away w/it.
The fact that he even had the time to write a book during the last 6 mos of a pandemic is incredible. 
Imagine if the gov of LA decided to write a book soon after Katrina hit?”
AN EXCELLENT Q
I haven’t said one negative word about K Welker and have only wished her luck!
😂 lol
Thank you Mr C and we are all good! 
No worries about ‘16!
Go for it! 
As long as you are younger and thinner
I think I’ve already made that clear
It’s fun being outside corporate media. 
Also we’ve been at the top of the podcast charts since our debut so thanks for listening! 
Trump bringing this guy - Bobulinski - to debate tonight. 😳 
Presser on site at 5p per @johnrobertsFox
Here is the most outrageous (meta?) part of the 60 Mins exchange:
Trump (re Biden) “he’s in the midst of a scandal.”
Leslie: “he’s not!”
Right - b/c the media won’t report on it. And then, when confronted w/the allegations, they say “no scandal to see here!”
Actually she tried to mock him (re: the economy) by saying “u know that’s not true,” &amp; then when he doubled down she retreated: “I’m not going to fact check u now.” 
But she just tried. 
In an effort to sound tough. & then didn’t have her facts ready. Ouch.
“Stormed out?” Oh please. 
This guy is brilliant! 
Love @JeremyDBoreing and you will too. 
Att’n @kwelkernbc @NBCNews:
“I would ask the Biden family to address the American people &amp; outline the facts... 
The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars through foreign entities...”

It’s back in the news today as Chris Pratt takes new fire for it.
@EllenPage says Hillsong hates gay ppl. 
Odd, since the first openly-gay person to ever hold a cabinet  position in the USA, @RichardGrenell, just told me today that it’s his church and how grateful he is to it: https://tinyurl.com/y4n298j7
Worth the read... 
Why is this deemed “sensitive content” when I see it tweeted by others??? Sensitive??
Keep reading you fool
Forgive the graphic nature of this, but this is so disturbing - look at these excerpts in James Lindsay’s two tweets below - this is grossly inappropriate for a fifth grader! 
They’re 10!! Abusive & wrong.
California parents: BEWARE.
Not-a-one. 
In today's episode of @MegynKellyShow I sit down with @RichardGrenell to discuss working for @realDonaldTrump, Hunter Biden, being a gay Republican, his faith and politics and his predictions for the election.

Uh oh! MANSPLAINER!
The UK’s Kemi Badenoch remains unafraid to tell the hard truths- like BLM is anti-capitalist, and that Black kids should not be taught that they are victims & whites, their oppressors.
So, maybe we can actually post stories about it now? Ask Biden (Joe &amp; Hunter) about it now? 
Surely now, the NYT, Wapo & others will pursue the story?
@coldxman and I had such a lovely, thoughtful exchange on so many tough subjects - sexism, race, police, etc. 
It’s been wonderful doing some press around my new podcast, and getting to spend time w/ppl like Coleman is the reason why.
She licks them every time we leave the apartment!
We have upped our pumpkin game, people.
I really hope ppl listen to this podcast. 
The last half hour, re the mssgs we send to girls/women, was really special to me.  
Why do we demonize stay-at-home motherhood? 
Why is more $$/power always prized? 
More than 1 friend has told me she cried listening to this pod.
LET’S HEAR FROM HUNTER!
H-was it ur laptop?
Did you leave it at a DE repair shop?
Did you arrange a mtg b/t Burisma’s #3 guy Pozharskyi & ur dad? Joe, did u attend that mtg?
H, did you cut a deal for $10m/year from Ye Jianming?
Were u negotiating another deal that wld pay ur dad?
This is absurd. 
Our family’s schools are thankfully open and operating safely and have done a great job of protecting the kids and teachers. 
It can be done if there is a willingness.
Open the damn schools.

My thanks to the fearless @abigailshrier, whose interview affected me profoundly. 
Thank you for the thought-provoking talk & for writing “Irreversible Damage.”

Check out my interview with her here:
Omg! Too perfect.
Yes, if we gals had a nickel for all the times we pleasured ourselves with active zoom calls going but thank goodness at least with the lens cov... oh wait. 
That’s not us. AT. ALL. 🤦‍♀️
I think I speak for, oh, pretty much everyone when I say STFU you absolute douchebag.
Thx for having me Joe Pags! 
Really enjoyed it! 
At a minimum, these wld be easy denials:
-Hunter Biden denies that the laptop in Q is his & that he ever gave a laptop to any repairman.
-Joe Biden explicitly denies that he ever met w/the Ukrainian official named in the NYP piece (not just that his calendar d/n/reflect the mtg).
Loved this @benshapiro - covered some dicey ground on this one! 
Thanks for having me.
