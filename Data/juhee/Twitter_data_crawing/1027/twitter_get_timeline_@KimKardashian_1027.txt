Also shout of to @MindyWeiss for putting this all together.  
You were there putting together all my birthday parties when I was a little girl so this definitely came full circle.
I can’t wait to share so many more birthday photos and videos with you guys soon and I thank each and everyone of you who reached out with birthday wishes✨

I spent all of my 30s having my birthday parties. 
Each and every detail that went into this was so special and I am forever grateful to my family for taking the time to put this together to celebrate me turning 40.
We then got to my 16th birthday party and my exact same car was there waiting for me with the same exact balloons with the same cake. 
After a while the curtains opened and the bottle service girls came out which happened to be my sisters and they re-created Tao night club, where
Then as I entered in the room I ended up at my second birthday then my fourth birthday leading up to my 10th birthday where my sisters did the same exact dance that they did for me when I turned 10.
My dad video taped and documented our whole lives so they showed each of the videos of my birthdays on a big screen behind the party. 
I entered into the room that started off at my first birthday party with the same ponies and the same cake, and my dad wishing me a happy 1st bday
You know I’m a sentimental person and this party was the most special. 
They re-created all of my special birthdays throughout my life from looking at all of our old home videos. 
They re-created the party, The same balloons, the same cake, everything!
All I can say is WOW! 
My mom and my sisters threw me the most epic surprise party that was so special in my heart. 
We showed it on E as a special so you guys got to see the behind the scenes of how it really went down.

Together, we continue to pray during this difficult time for the many men, women, and children who have been impacted by the war.
We are one global Armenian nation.
💪🏼❤️🙏🏼✊🏼🇦🇲
Thank you to all the individuals at the Library of Congress, members of Congress, @ANCA_DC &amp; @UCLA library for working tirelessly on the efforts to continue to advocate for Armenians.
This landmark news was announced nearly one year after recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the U.S. Congress and in the setting of the recent devastating attacks on Armenians in Artsakh.
The best birthday present!!
Today, the United States Library of Congress announced it will now use the subject heading…Armenian Genocide.
