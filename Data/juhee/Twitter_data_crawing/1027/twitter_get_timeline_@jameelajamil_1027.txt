But I bet I told you they are you babe marks and cool because they’re a sign you’re taking up space! which is GOOD. 
I have them everywhere. 
But screen grab this. 
Incase I wipe/ delete my account!
Hi. No specific tweets have been deleted. 
My whole Twitter was wiped in July this year when I handed my Twitter over to only being for my podcast and young activists for a few months while I took time off to write. 
You can check for yourself. ❤️
Hi love been spreading info for 3 days on my Instagram x
Busy Philips episode out now! 
Busy Phillips episode out now 
Quibi failed. 
Netflix is thriving.
It amazes me how often people forget that perhaps it’s the way our country/world TREATS trans people that makes them unhappy, rather than being trans itself. 
You’re too ignorant to even respect HIS gender after HIS death. 
You’re the problem. 
You’re the sickness.
It’s like a chef only cooking their one Favourite dish otherwise. 
The restaurant would close down.
I don’t make the rules. 🤷🏽‍♀️ 
My puppy was on the cover of Harpers Bazaar. 
I was also there but who the fuck cares? It’s a PUPPY. 
Did 5 members of Pence’s team really test positive for covid or does the administration just want us to forget that a Melania decoy was used today? 🤔
She’s going to win the whole series. An angel. 
Ha they were the default on the page. 
I don’t know how much I weigh so I wouldn’t be able to even answer it!
Hey I’m specifically talking about Net-a-Porter and Mr Porter in the tweet as is fairly clear I think.
🤣
Not on the male version of this site...
I am so sick of women’s sizing. 
Men get clear inches/cm, and we get asked what we WEIGH?! 
As if weight indicates definitive size or shape. 
Hey @NETAPORTER I think this is an inappropriate and frankly  unscientific way to “help” a woman find her size. 
@MRPORTERLIVE doesn’t do this
Yep everyone has xx
❤️
Hey guys I can point you in the direction of some excellent Black activists and social commentators who will be far more valuable here than I would be. ❤️
❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
Ah ❤️
Angel!
Progress not perfection. 
We are all learning. 
Even if some pretend they have no further knowledge to gain.
Last day you can vote for me for the E people’s choice award for best podcast. 
I’m also nominated for best comedy star, but I’m up against Issa Rae, so don’t bother because she is god.
What is going on? in 2020?! 
Why are we seeing reproductive rights roll back this fast? 
This is in Poland, and it’s coming to the US IF YOU DON’T BLOODY VOTE.

She doesn’t know! 
She was just born that way. 
She wishes she was cooler. 
But she never will be!
Every time. Every single time.

Anyone know how much of TiKToks revenue comes from selling diet products? 
(They are seemingly directed mostly at women...)
I am reposting his now deleted tweet not to cause him grief, and please know he has apologized, But it’s important for context to my response. He is not the first, nor will he be the last to think it’s funny or clever to diminish my work.
Hello mate, wrote this for you and your flustered friends to merely consider mid-eye roll. 👍🏽 
So cool!
Not at all. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It’s not this specific thing, it’s just an endless wave of it. 
Do they want to just tell all women not to bother unless they are perfect and fully educated? 
Is that the road to mass progress or should we encourage everyone to scrap in and help and champion actually TRYING?
My feelings are not hurt, I know I’m an easy punchline for clicks, and am more than accustomed to it, but to reduce my inclusion to a meme, is hilarious. 
Amazing
Without downloading new pics where are you mentally? 
So proud of this series we made @i_weigh big LOVE to @jamie_windust @tomallencomedy and @sojen10 ❤️
Please vote. Please. 
I know you don’t want either butThis is a humanitarian crisis CAUSED and maintained by the current administration.

A young person called Courtney Birch painted me onto a skateboard and I think that’s cool. 👍🏽 
This is how my dog sleeps. 
(The little paw protectively covering his dick while he lays like a fancy porn star.) 
This is a very extreme reaction to me asking you to be on my podcast... 😂
Who did? I will beat them.
Two legends.
The best.
Ah the old dj days. I miss them!

A pic of us Getting ready for the Cambridge Union address today. 
So sad to have not been there in person but I’m thankful that you had me, and the questions were all fantastic and thoughtful. ❤️ 
I spoke to the stunningly wonderful @jilly_peppa on my podcast about her life, her lessons and all of the things she wants the world to understand about disabled people. 
She taught me so much, and was so fun and honest and we had such an open dialogue devoid of stigma and taboo.
Shhhhhhhhhhhh
I live with this man. 👌🏽👌🏽
Bloody wow 🤩
