thank you
I've also been told that absentee ballots are never counted unless they need to be. 
For all of the absentee ballots coming in now ... are they counting them now? 
Or only on election day and if they have to? 
#Election2020AG
question: if you apply for an absentee ballot and receive it ... can you still vote in person? 
how do they know?  
how does it work?

Fall made its first real appearance today ... high of 52. leaves flying everywhere. 
Goodbye Indian summer. :(
Sunday headline ... maybe all of October headline. 
#COVID19 
what about the baby clinic? Giuliani? 
conservative women's meeting?
Just watched @BoratSagdiyev 2 -- remembering when I interviewed Borat on Fox&amp;Friends 13 years ago - introduced to his brilliance. 
If only you could have helped me through the next 11 years there ... 
Thank you for your humor!

I love @KendraScott on @ABCSharkTank - midwestern values and roots ‚Äî hard worker who never gave up!!

We couldn't do this story without naming the winner of the debate &amp; that's Kristen Welker for her sharp moderating, keeping the discussion moving and the candidates on topic. 
I think the last debate moderator Chris Wallace is jealous. 
In fact, he said exactly that.)
Thank you!
This just came sauntering out of nowhere and crawled across my windshield and then slithered back into the upholstery siding. 
Where will it show up next? Ugh!!!!
My apolitical debate take away: 
What other time in history have we credited a Presidential candidate for reeling it in so much there was no embarrassment?
The bar‚Äôs been lowered so far we‚Äôre now surprised when we see decorum? Lmk thoughts.

You cannot keep this secret...and you shouldn‚Äôt. 
Evil behavior thrives in dark places. 
Ghislaine Maxwell‚Äôs 2016 deposition for the Jeffrey Epstein case made public today.
Trump: I‚Äôm the least racist person in this room.

There‚Äôs a certain fire from @VP44 tonight. 
Not seeing the senile accusations. 
#PresidentialDebate2020
The mute button is working ... thank God. #PresidentialDebate2020
@kwelkernbc ‚Äî asking Trump why he calls Faici a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù. 
It‚Äôs not about Fauci saying don‚Äôt wear a mask 7 months ago. 
Trump called him a disaster just 2 days ago. 
#PresidentialDebate2020
She‚Äôs doing a great job - @kwelkernbc ‚Äî in command and doing follow ups. 
#PresidentialDebate2020
I‚Äôd love to have a vaccine in weeks but I‚Äôll bet you a lot that will never happen
Thank you!
Welker: Love the question ‚Äî is the vaccine coming within weeks? 
(No it‚Äôs not.)
Trump says it is. 
#PresidentialDebate2020
Here we go ... how will the mute button go? 
Will the candidates abstain because they know they won‚Äôt be heard anyway? 
Hmmmm ... 
#PresidentialDebate2020
thank you!
@NickLaparra @LetsGiveADamn looking forward to it!
The final fight ‚Äî starts tonight ‚Äî with one major change. 
Mute.

Amazing interview with #ConnieChung on @cnn @brikeilarcnn show about her interview with Pres Trump long before he was President with the same treatment towards a woman as he does now. 
Very very interesting.

Check out part of my #WomanOfTheWeek interview from my new #GetTheNewsWithGretchen podcast on @QuakeMedia today with one of my badass lawyers @NancyErickaSmith about how harassment in the workplace is APOLITICAL. 
It‚Äôs why we should be able to solve it TOGETHER. 
Let‚Äôs do it.

Thank you @Pontifex 
Great Catching up with you 
Very very interesting journalistic question that CBS is no doubt mulling over right now. 
Progress 
The same old same old. 
Slut shaming women ... hoping it will work. 
How do these lawyers sleep at night? 
I‚Äôm going to make sure this stops. 
We keep pushing for change. 
Stay strong @JenniferEckhart - there‚Äôs an army supporting u. 
Thank you! 
Yes progress has been made but much work still remains! 
I am dedicated to doing it!
