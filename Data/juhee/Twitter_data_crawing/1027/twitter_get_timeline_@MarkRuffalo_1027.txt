They learned the lessons of 2016 (+ the last four years) and revived the power of journalistic integrity. 
The actually vetted the Hunter Biden story. 
There is simply no there, there.  
It‚Äôs not that journalists didn‚Äôt do their work that there is no story here. 
It‚Äôs that they did!
This is so beautiful! 
Bravo and thank you for bringing this up front. 
This election will shape a more fair and just America. 
An America for ALL of us, together.

Thank you SenatorSchumer! 
This is good trouble.
He thinks it‚Äôs a ghost town because he will be haunted here, if he ever comes back. 
Look how he ran away from Leslie Stahl! Boo!
Okay. Now, let‚Äôs let the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù decide.

If you want to be inspired &amp; feel hopeful about the future of this country, watch this incredible documentary @UsKidsFilm for FREE tonight until midnight! 
This is the story of the kids who started @AMarch4OurLives movement & how young people turned out to vote in 2018.
The guy has no core at all. 
He stands for nothing. 
‚ÄúYou are on your own folks!‚Äù
Same as his Corona Virus plan. 
It‚Äôs the ‚Äúif you ain‚Äôt rich, die!‚Äù Plan.
What a little baby!  
He just threw a fit and sent his press secretary to carry in his snotty Kleenex.
Making me feel how I WANT to feel right now.
Thanks¬†@MoveOn! 
Looking forward to tonight at 8pm ET with the next Vice President of the United States @KamalaHarris.

Let's win this!

With today‚Äôs news from the White House where they have  admitted to giving up on Covid prevention all together, this shit isn‚Äôt funny, it‚Äôs just deadly.
So the WH, who says they have done a great job controlling Covid, is now saying they have lost control. 
They never had it in control. 
The new message is ‚Äúgive up preventing it and deal with it when you are sick and maybe dying‚Äù. 
The poor, old and sick will die. 
Shameful bastards.
This is going to be hilarious.

Wait a minute, the same thing happens to me! 
They say they are super patriotic and are really into the constitution but I should just shut up and act. 
Which is weird because there is a lot of talking in acting. 
They really are confusing.
It looks like the @IvankaTrump @jaredkushner threat to the Lincoln Project was just a can of beans. 
"Your clients are no longer mere Upper Eastside Socialites, able to sue at the slightest offense to their personal sensitivities."
Boo!
This is so good you guys. 
It‚Äôs so true.

@mehdirhasan Thank you Mehdi, as we are dealing with real antisemitism here in the USA @mikepompeo is abroad demonizing the groups that are here on the ground fighting it, while his beloved leader, Trump, calls Nazis good people. 
We didn‚Äôt hear a peep from Mike then! 
Total fake!
Damn! Between @mehdirhasan and @ambermruffin @peacockTV is on üî•!
And @mikepompeo is a hazard.

You are the best, Senator Stabenow! 
Thank you for fighting to keep folks health care and for fighting to protect families and communities against the poison of PFAS.
No Confirmation Before Inauguration https://t.co/TnoJNL9IeW via @YouTube
We need Sen Peters in Congress  to fight corporate greed and protect your family from the poison of PFAS! 
@MarkFavors and I testified on capital hill regarding #PFAS and only 4 GOP members showed up saying polluters shouldn‚Äôt pay. 
They think you should pay. 
It‚Äôs perverse.
Re-upping this today. 
You must know And Follow Amber Ruffin.

Want to really know about the #GreenNewDeal Professor Mark Z. 
Jacobson is one of the really bright people who helped create the science behind it.
Damn Mark! You buried this guy. 
Science and facts matter. 
That poor guy should go back and do his homework. 
It wasn‚Äôt fair.
This is a great debate. 
Jobs, Cleaner Energy, Cheaper Energy and lower health care costs are all the benefits of the #GreenNewDeal.  
Stanford Professor Mark Jacobson Hulk smashes the oil and gas lobbyist in this debate. 
He brings the receipts!! üî•üß®üí£ (boom)

Hey folks, we are still fighting to shut down the #DAPL pipeline. 
Lend a hand and let's bring the work we did in #StandingRock all the way home.
@CindyHydeSmith really doesn't want to answer the question if fighting to keep slaves was the best part of Mississippi history. 
There is nothing good or noble about it. 
It's time to turn the page on fetishizing slavery and the Confederacy's fight to keep it going. 
It's ugly.
It would create A LOT of new jobs.

WE are one people, we are the family of America. 
This is very moving. 
The colossal "bombardment of dishonesty" by Donald last night was a national and international embarrassment. 
Corona Virus is NOT going away. 
It's on the climb again. 
Over 1000 Americans died yesterday alone. 
We went to war in Iraq for the death toll we will see in two days.

The difference between Biden and Trump is clear. 
Biden is the candidate of possibility.
Trump tells us it‚Äôs not his fault, it doesn‚Äôt exist or it‚Äôs impossible to fix. 
From Climate Change, Police Reform, Covid,Racism, Trump offers nothing. 
Biden has plans to address all of them.
You are absolutely right. 
Thank you, Blair.
Dear Blair, you are right on here. 
That is profound and true. 
I stand corrected. 
I always learn from you and always come away more mindful of the power and depth of our words and what they mean. 
But also what is being left out of the conversation. 
Thank you.

Oh, man. ouch.
Add the entire Stanford University civil engineer department lead by @mzjacobson.
I love them sooo much. 
There aren't enough President and VP positions for all of them. 
Hmmm...Stack the Executive Branch?
Disgusting, unpresidential, Racist and another lie!  
Trump has a unmissable "tell" to know when he is lying. 
His mouth is moving.
#BlueWave2020 
Just a recap....https://t.co/CJLCtNubv2 via @TheDemocrats
Joe Biden spoke the Truth with grace and poise and stood his ground against every one of Trumps lies. 
#BidenWon 
#debates
I want to live in a country where we have a President who isn't a colossal liar. 
#WithBidenWeCan
Stop whining about the IRS, and RELEASE YOUR RETURNS. 
Yes, he called him the the most racist president in modern history. 
That did happen. 
#debates
Trump says he will let Blue states die without help from the federal government. 
Biden would NEVER EVER betray a state because of how they vote or what political party they follow.

By the way, while you are here, @JohnCornyn is a #TrumpStepfordWife he has voted with him every single time. 
Don't buy his, "I tried to stand up to him, (privately)." 
Vote for @mjhegar!! 
I wish I could. 
#Debate2020
Trump's love of the fossil fuel industry will kill us and our oceans and the beautiful animals that live in them and along them.

#Debates2020
The #GND is the New Deal for this hurting generation. 
It will create the jobs our youth need, and it will make the USA more resilient and ready to deal with Climate Crisis we are already living through. 
It's time the older generation makes way for the youth! 
#Debates2020
Natural gas is not only dirty it's 70x more heat trapping than CO2. 
#Debates2020 Fracking still sucks by the way.
Trump calls Climate Change a hoax. 
The Green New Deal was based on science and will create 5 million new jobs for our young people. 
Retrofitting buildings Pay for themselves. 
#Debates2020
Our water is more polluted than it has ever been, Lead, PFAS and radio active material from fracking is poisoning our families while Trump is destroying clean water protections. 
It's a bold faced lie what he saying about the water. 
#Debates2020
This is the truth about Trump's environmental legacy. 
More than 200 million Americans could have toxic PFAS in their drinking water 
#Debates2020
Trump's racist comments about telling the suburbs that Corey Booker was going to ruin their neighborhoods with "Affordable Housing" is racist. 
#Debates2020
#BlackLivesMatter 
Trump has used race to repeatedly to tear this country up. 
He won't condemn Nazis he didn't condemn White Nationalists and he has told the racist Proud Boys to, "Stand By".
Trump is a liar, Biden is an honorable man who raised his boys on his own after his wife was killed in a car accident.
Exactly.
Let's talk about Trump trying to get the Central Park 5 murdered by the state. 
5 totally innocent men. 
#Debates2020
Family Separation is an amoral stain on this country that will be remembered throughtout time. 
It was a heinous and cruel and evil policy and it continues to be an evil and cruel policy with over 520 kids who have lost their families. #Debates2020
They have lost their parents! 
How can they be well taken care of? 
They are in fucking prisons, they are not "WELL TAKEN CARE OF". 
It's an atrocity. 
It's sick and it's a sin. 
#Debates2020
TRUMP and the GOP have torn 520 Children from their parents! 
They came with their parents. 
It's not Coyotes, it was their parents. 
This is an atrocity that TRUMP and GOP committed.
AMERICAN WORKERS DESERVE $15 per HOUR!
400K business have closed because Trump did not lead the country out of Covid.
#debate
Um...MUTE&gt;TRUMP.
The Stock Market Rocks under Democratic Presidents. 
We put the country back together after GOP Presidents wreck it.
#Debate2020
‚ÄúHealthcare is not a privilege, it a right!‚Äù 
Yes!! People in the richest country in the world need healthcare! 
Trump isn‚Äôt doing a damn thing for healthcare. 
#Debate2020
Biden‚Äôs plan will NOT take away healthcare from anyone!  
It expands insurance for everyone! 
Plus protect pre existing conditions. #Debates2020
I‚Äôm sorry. 
Not only are you not winning the House you are going to loose the Presidency. 
It time for you to start thinking of what country you are leaving to. 
#Debates2020
We need the Affordable Care Act In The Middle Of A Pandemic! 
Trump said he is getting rid of it.
Trump send love letters to North Korean dictator, he takes the word of Putin and of the Saudi murderer MBS as they kill our journalists and taking out bounties on our military men and women.
Donald Trump has foreign conflicts of interest. 
He has never put his corporations in a blind trust. 
His children are wildly involved in politics and his businesses. There is no firewall between them.
