Please hold onto your tickets as they remain valid for the rescheduled dates. 
I miss being on tour the most especially during this time and I can’t wait to be reuniting with you all and celebrating soon!!
It’s with a heavy heart I will be postponing my upcoming European tour to September and October 2021. 
We have continued to monitor this unprecedented and changing situation, and it has become clear that it is not possible to go ahead with the tour in January and February.
Thrilled to hear I’m nominated in 4 categories at the #Los40MusicAwards 2020 for Best Artist, Best Album, Best Song and Best Video! 
Thank you so much @Los40, I love you Spain 🇪🇸
