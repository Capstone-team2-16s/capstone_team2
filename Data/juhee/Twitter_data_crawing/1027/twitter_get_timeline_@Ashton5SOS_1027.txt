Hello my name is Ashton and I’m finally on Tik Tok ( 😂 ) 

Thank you honey bee 💚💚💚
Just reminded me of how we speak to each other in 5SOS lol 😂
Thank you for allowing me to try and be a light and help. 
Absolutely incredible considering I didn’t have any music released over a month ago. 
This is amazing GROWTH.
Staying in my room all day and listening to Superbloom
The Greyhound Guitar solo
“Greyhounds dart around a racetrack lightning fast. They eat lean and are trained to win and NEVER loose.” 
Over the past month, since the release of Skinny Skinny, and now releasing SUPERBLOOM, I’ve felt so much respect, kindness and love from my family, everyone on here, and my friends. 
Thank you for everything! 
I hope you love my album for a long time to come.
Blood of the rabbit,
It stains my teeth. 
I got my whole ass nipples exposed for all of Toronto to see
THIS. Yes, you’re sharing the album and amplifying it’s voice in a way that is incredible 💚
“SUPERBLOOM is a bright Lotus in a mud pile of a year” 
#SUPERBLOOM is officially here. 
I hope you find positivity and a welcoming feeling to my little world of music. 
I have enjoyed every single step of making this record and am a better person today because of it, and look forward to what is to come!
“The over-arching narrative is support system, healing, recovery, strength and focus on true self. 
I felt like I had a lot to write about,”
“Developing a kinder voice to myself, developing the need to dig into my narrative as a lyricist, and share that with people. 
Because if it’s happened to me, it’s happened to a lot of people.”

Cannot wait for you all to hear #SUPERBLOOM tonight. 
Join me in listening live on my Instagram at 9pm PST 💚
TONIGHT 💚

SUPERBLOOM in 2 days.
The 3 Me’s 
Totally! We did a version of this too; 
I thought it felt a little retro for the feeling of Superbloom, it’s so cool though!

The pure energy this emits is amazing. Nice work
Thanks Jess, really excited to share some new material with you 💚💚💚
You can still order CD’s! 
They’ll come from AUS though
Yes! I fumble around mainly Pro Create. 
@kaykay is the photoshop wizard. She’s incredible at it. 
It’s definitely an ambition of mind to work on that next year, it’d really help with my Merch designs.
Only 3 more days until #SUPERBLOOM 💚
Massive win’s all round!
Sunshine ☀️
Considering I’m working independently apart from in AUS. 
I didn’t want to make CD’s for every market because the format isn’t popular anymore. 
So most music markets will be streaming (DSP’s) and Vinyl (the way I intended people to listen)
This sketch turned into these images!
Here’s some sketches of font’s and images I wanted to take that I was thinking up before actually going and going and actualizing things. 
Thought I’d share! X

Man... this is so cool, very stoked.
It’s just something I do when I write music, I always write on the windows, etc. focusing all my energy on the music
