Cos that worked so well when she was introduced 😳

If this is as you state it, it is disgraceful, and hope the full force of law is brought against those responsible. 
The glory of democracy and freedom of speech is people can express their views without fear of attack - whether Jews for Trump or Jews for Biden. 
No ifs or buts
Trump team believe they’re seeing a re-run of 2016. 
All down to sprint for line. 
But, but, but - some v big diffs between now and then and early voting numbers are astonishing
Fabulous.... 
This will lift @realDonaldTrump campaign spirits...
This ain’t done...
#Election2020 
Whaaaaat the......? 
#Adele brilliant on #SNL last night. 

As if the world wasn’t divided enough....
Does that translate as: ‘I may be the @VP and head of the @WhiteHouse #coronavirus task force, but there’s an election to fight so will be ignoring the guidelines I’ve asked the rest of the American people to follow?’
Detail in this poll is interesting... 
When rhetoric flies in face of reality: 
@realDonaldTrump has just said at rally in NC: "We're rounding the turn. 
Our numbers are incredible." 
Yesterday #coronavirus stats:
85,000 new cases - worst day on record
41,000 in hospital
900+ deaths
How is this turning corner?
These numbers are amazing #Election2020 
For my sins I’m a Spurs supporter - and last Sunday when we were 3-0 up against West Ham with 8 mins left, I would have said we had victory wrapped up......
Oh bloody thanks Maitlis. 
Just woken up. 
And see that cheap jibe. 
Well only one way to test it - subscribe now...
For the record I like to think of myself as the shy, modest, diffident type 🤥
TBH surprised the drop isn’t  sharper given the first #Debates2020 mess. 
Still a huge number though
@robertmooreitv Haha. 
Cut piece this morning. 
Did podcast and flew....
Band sound-checking. 
Incredible sky. 
Some residual warmth in air. 
#Georgetown 
you look really pretty tonight 
My report on last night’s #Debates2020 https://t.co/SdoFnrb74x via @YouTube
I think a quick health warning needed about this episode. 
@awzurcher disses #JaffaCakes and #TheArchers - 
I think he will need a security detail next time he comes to the UK...that is, if he’s allowed in #ShameOnZurch
Thanks David...
Latest episode of #Americast just done....with @maitlis and @awzurcher
Phew......
Departing the stage from #Debates2020 last night 
😳 
Good mention or bad mention? 
Asking for a friend.....
Arguably  greatest achievement of his presidency are these peace deals signed with Israel, which are hugely noteworthy. 
And yet haven’t featured so far, and will probably shift few votes in #Election2020
She’s always ticking me off...
And only 11 days away.....
Yes
Yes
Hi Peter - hope you enjoy. 
And sincerely h… https://t.co/rBiPRO4FZ6
One other shout out tonight from #Debates2020 - 
I thought @HCAhealthcare in Nashville did a stunning job on #covid testing for all of us who needed access to debate site. 
Brilliantly well organised, and a model of how we can get back to some normality pre-vaccine
And the winner of tonight’s debate was.....
Great job. 
And equally tough on both men
#KudostoKristen
Have just come back from a #Debates2020 watch party that @realDonaldTrump supporters had organised. 
Apparently 3 weeks ago for 1st debate it was rammed. 
About 15 people there tonight. 
Will be interesting to see if that’s reflected in TV viewing figures
@realDonaldTrump arguing that the kids separated from their parents at the border 'are being looked after so well' is a pretty extraordinary claim to make. 
They have been made orphans by US policy 
#Debates2020
you will be smashed if you drink a shot every time Biden says 'malarkey'
Genuine questions
What does it mean to say your bank account in China is listed?
What does pre-paying your income tax mean?
#Debates2020
The shouting has been replaced by grimaces, mock laughter, eye rolls that would make an amateur dramatics ham blush - but infinitely preferable to Cleveland
#Debates2020
"what are you hiding?" 
@JoeBiden says to @realDonaldTrump over his tax returns. 
#Debates2020
interesting observation 
Early, I know. 
But @kwelkernbc is presiding over an illuminating and much more thoughtful debate that the American people will appreciate #KudostoKristen 
#Debates2020
do you think @JoeBiden and @realDonaldTrump have got written on their hands 'remember to be polite and do not shout?' 
#Debates2020
"I take full responsibility," says @realDonaldTrump over #coronavirus before very fast pivoting away and blaming China 
#Debates2020
There is a strangely sullen atmosphere between @realDonaldTrump and @JoeBiden in #Debates2020 - no shouting, as if they are still exhausted from the fight they had last time
very bullish about the prospects for vaccine 
#Debates2020
"I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries by what we've been able to do," says @realDonaldTrump over his handing of #coronavirus. 
would be genuinely interested to know which. 
#Debates2020
@kwelkernbc looking composed and poised as she greets the First Lady and Dr Jill Biden - seeming to show no nerves. 
#Debates2020
No but those V-twin engines make a lovely noise
This is just the motorcycle part of the convoy ferrying @realDonaldTrump in #Nashville ahead of #Debates2020 
Remarkable thing about this is that 3 weeks ago he was prepping @realDonaldTrump for first debate. 
Now ahead of final #Debates2020 bemoaning stupidity of not wearing a mask. 
Not so subtle attack on president’s policies
And we’ll be recording another podcast tomorrow post-debate 
Am struck by the very down beat tone of the president at start of this interview. 
Much less pugilistic. 
Much less swagger. 
Seems fed up before interview even begins
Well said.. 
Cricket ball/long grass
“magnificently brilliant” 😳 
???????😳😳😳 
This....  
#revelinginherdiscomfort 
Hake news...
Oh Rudy....this does not read well 
Pleasure. 
Hope you enjoy the night. 
Remember Florida is key to on the night reporting
Fair point....
do you remember our incisive student journalism??
@realDonaldTrump will like this....
Good question Hasan. 
The assumption, and I stress assumption, is that big turnout early helps the Dems- but that might all be nullified by big turnout on day for Trump. 
So dangerous to draw too many conclusions
Hey - have a great night. 
When I was a journalism student it was me and @steverichards14 commentating on the eckham by-election! 
Glad to see you guys are starting with the most consequential presidential election in decades
Huge lines of people voting early here in Nashville, Tennessee for #Election2020. 
So far 36 million Americans have already voted - that’s more than a quarter of total turnout in 2016 - and still nearly two weeks to polling day
In a sophisticated, 1st world country, this is horrifying. 
It is one thing to separate mothers from their hildren - and people will have their own views on that - but to do so without the necessary paperwork and bureaucratic measures so they later can be reunited is shameful
???
👏👏👏👏👏 
Odd.... 
Is Electrolux a brand here...?
Encouraging.... 
Wow... 
First Lady @FLOTUS had been due to attend her first rally of campaign with @realDonaldTrump but has pulled out, citing ill health - her spokeswoman saying tho she feels better there's 'a lingering cough, and out of an abundance of caution, she will not be traveling today.'
Take that....
#Fauci hits back
What is so obnoxious about this is that before boarding it is made clear that EVERYONE has to wear a mask. 
If passenger objects, s/he shouldn’t have got on. 
But instead is delaying everyone else 🙄
And @realDonaldTrump campaign response to new #Debate2020 rules..... 
Key par in statement from the #Debate2020 commission. 
I think this is less draconian than @realDonaldTrump campaign feared, and doesn’t go as far as some others were demanding

Is this normal? 
Exxon releasing statement like this? 
Am I right in thinking back in January he complimented her on landing a weekend show, telling her ‘They made a very wise decision.’??
the numbers who've already voted in #Elections2020 are incredible. 
25 million so far (that's about 20% of total who voted 4 years ago)
still not convinced the final #Debates2020 will take place 
Wonder whether this shows strength or vulnerability. 
Iowa? N Carolina?
@realDonaldTrump goes after #DrFauci in campaign call with staff, saying "People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots....he's been here 500 years" 
Risky strategy: polls have shown Fauci far more trusted on #covid  than the president
