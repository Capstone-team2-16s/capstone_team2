Apparently snowbirds aren’t the only ones who move to Florida. 
Snowflakes do too.
“But Vlad, Vlad. 
I thought we were amigos.” 
Baseball is just beautiful, and surprising, tense, and comforting. 
It’s unlike anything else I have ever seen. 
And I love it.
We are 9 days out and tonight’s Hank Williams hit is "Why Don't You Love Me.” 
It has gems of lyrics like “I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through.” Humor and truth.
Perhaps Donald Trump underestimates how many Americans are just sick and tired of all the bullshine.
So the administration goes on the Sunday shows to say they are surrendering to the virus? 
First of all, appalling. 
And second, maybe not the best closing argument to a nation being overrun by said virus.
Wild end to a wild game. 
We have a series.
The World Series feels like a seesaw and I’m like a 5 year old on a playground. Loving it.
A cynicism as expansive as the cosmos.
I always found it somewhat ironic that Amazon has #WhatUnitesUs listed as #1 in the “Nationalism” category considering a big message of the book is we need to disentangle the positive notion of “patriotism” from the toxic notion of “nationalism.”
An important follow on Twitter.
Sad word comes this morning that my friend and neighbor Jerry Jeff Walker has passed away. 
My condolences to his wonderful wife Susan and all his friends and family. 
He was a brilliant songwriter, singer, musician, and all around good guy. 
He will be missed.
Hadn’t seen this @Guinz but credit where credit is due. 
10 days to go, and the next Hank Williams song in our #1 Hits Jukebox Election Countdown is "Long Gone Lonesome Blues." 
It starts with the line "I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by..." 
A story of loneliness unfolds from there. 
Great song.
Imagine if they worked as hard to WIN the vote as they do to SUPPRESS the vote.
Thank you Jackie McMichael.
Thank you. 
I like to say Sarah Cooper is the Sarah Cooper of comedy.
Thank you. 
You’re a good Twitter follow as well.
Mask not what your country. 
can do for you. 
Mask is what you can do for your country.
I love this. Thanks for sharing. 
This election is all about our climate crises:
-  a climate of fear
-  a climate of injustice
-  a climate of ignorance
-  a climate of cruelty
- and encompassing all, the physical climate of our fragile home that teeters on the brink of catastrophe.
This rhetoric sounds more like the Bay of Pigs. 
This is deadly, deadly serious. 
The least racist person in the room.
There are 11 days to the election. 
And guess what. 
Hank Williams had 11 number one country hits. 
We're going to count them down. 
Today, it's Lovesick Blues. 
I close my eyes, listen, and a smile crosses my face. 
So many memories. 
Happy Friday!
Bibi reading the polls. 
And Donald Trump having the look of a sidekick being told he may not be invited to the party.
A huge thank you to all of you as we wrap up our first #WhatUnitesUs Indie Bookstore Challenge. 
We've got a last bit of business - a few copies remaining at @BookPassage. 
Please help this great local business by clearing their shelves. You can order here: https://t.co/Rf0Ic70o8Q?amp=1
This all makes a lot of sense when you realize COVID-19 isn’t a problem outside of Earth. 
Oh, and “Waiting for Infrustructure Week” gets renewed. Yay.
It's the LAST DAY of the #WhatUnitesUs Indie Bookstore Challenge. 
Thank you all for your support. 
We have a great one: @BookPassage in the Bay Area. 
They have 24 copies. 
Please, let's finish the week by quickly emptying their shelves.

That’s an analogy win.
A tip of the Stetson to Kristen Welker. 
A consummate pro on a big and difficult stage.
This was not the Donald Trump of the last debate. 
That’s a win for him, as far as that goes. 
But there is substance and there is style. 
When it's distilled to soundbites, will something pop? 
What matters? 
What might move votes? 
I suspect little.
For those who are tempted to analyze the “tone” of the debate, a hint: Just because you're not yelling, doesn't mean what you're saying is true.
I know more about wind (I think he means hot air).
Climate change: Now is the time in the evening when we “debate” about the factual equivalent of the Earth orbiting the Sun.
It’s amazing how many of Donald Trump’s questions can be answered by the name Mitch McConnell.
Facts are pesky. 
It’s important to remember that tens of millions of Americans have already voted.
Now is the time of the debate when we get into the Fox News alternate universe talking points and most Americans are scratching their heads with no idea of what Donald Trump is talking about.
When you tone down the "act," and keep the lies, I suspect many Americans who have made up their minds might have turned the channel. 
Are you watching?
None of this gets any less surreal. Or less sad.
We wrap up tomorrow (spoiler, not in Colorado). 
We are looking for future indie bookstore challenges but haven't set anything up yet.
You gotta give @PeteButtigieg credit. 
He knows how to break through the truth bubble on Fox News. 
I’m sort of surprised they keep having him on.
You're as likely to see the Republican health care plan as you are to see a giraffe saunter through the Arctic. 
Rip Van Winkle can wake up and it will still be two weeks away.
I'm most excited about "Where it's going to go!" 
Thank you.

A very interesting perspective... 
A beautiful change of pace on Twitter. 
And a worthy follow @patrickdextervc for music from a breathtaking setting. 
Watching the World Series. 
I am thinking I wish there was a way to put the shift on for American democracy.
I don’t know Josh, seems like many people are recommending a book called #WhatUnitesUs by some upstart reporter. 
Not all authors have the R.N.C. buying books to pump sales. 
News that #WhatUnitesUs is on the NY Times bestsellers list is thanks to all of YOU. 
With humility and gratitude.
P.S. #vote #WhatUnitesUs 
Thank you @PorterSqBooks for your enthusiasm around our #WhatUnitesUs 
Indie Bookstore challenge! 
After two days on the coasts, we head into the American heartland for Day 4 of the challenge.
So stay tuned...
So much of the injustices of America, past and present, are found in the intersection of race and the vote.
It's Day 3 of our #WhatUnitesUs "indie bookstore challenge." 
We're in venerable Cambridge, MA and the wonderful @PorterSqBooks. 
They have 24 copies of the paperback In stock. 
Let's support a great local business by clearing them out.

Happy to retweet. 
Glad you enjoyed the book. 
#Steady 
Your old 1-6-3 groundout to end Game 1.  
It feels good watching a World Series.
Can Tampa Bay rally?
A national shame. 
There must be accountability for this horror.
