Post #Brexit trade negotiations continue this week between EU and UK. 
All quiet on the political posturing front..
Negotiators are effectively in a negotiating ‚tunnel’ without actually calling it that
Spain’s PM has once again declared a state of ‚alarm‘ across the country because of rising #covid cases. 
The decree allows the government to impose certain measures eg restricting people’s movements. 
Sanchez is looking to extend the decree till May..
Restaurants across Italy shut at 6pm from today as part of a raft of new #Covid restrictions. 
Government scientific advisors are quoted as saying this should help restrict family gatherings, particularly on Sundays. 
Measure set to last till 24 Nov..
Political posturing? 
Bilateral chest-beating? 
EU *finally* admitting it must compromise too? 
Michel Barnier helping the PM sell a compromise deal? 
Whatever of the above went into the mix over the last few days, talks are back on for this final phase 👇 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54633757
yes
Agreed joint principles for renewed EU-UK trade talks 👇 https://t.co/wZCJKrdu8v
Barnier has simply re-tweeted the European Commission President this afternoon who said „Hard work needed, no time to lose“

As both sides have made clear, it takes two to reach an agreement.  
It is entirely possible that negotiations will not succeed.  
If so, the UK will end the transition period on Australia terms and will prosper in doing so.“
But we are ready with the EU to see if it is possible to bridge them in intensive talks.  
For our part, we remain clear that the best and most established means of regulating the relationship between two sovereign and autonomous parties is one based on a free trade agreement“
As to the substance, we note that Mr Barnier set out the principles that the EU has brought to this negotiation, and that he also acknowledged the UK’s established red lines.  
It is clear that significant gaps remain be
A No.10 spokesman said: We have studied carefully the statement by Michel Barnier to the European Parliament this morning.  
As the EU’s Chief Negotiator his words are authoritative.“
Talks back on! 
#Brexit
As we await word of Michel Barnier and David Frost's daily call .. Are talks back on? 
Mood music better today from Downing Street.. 
Both sides looking for a way back to the table? 
My thoughts: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54633757
Oh! Pardon

Frankly not many Europeans are following this non-negotiating-but-still-in-contact dance of the moment. 
Those from member states observing/involved in the wider issue of negotiations here in Brussels say they’re *not impressed* 
(I’m summarising and stating it politely)
UK still not happy .. referring to the call this afternoon between the the UK’s and the EU’s chief negotiators, a No 10 spokesperson said “Lord Frost and Michel Barnier had a constructive discussion. 
The situation remained as yesterday, and they will remain in contact.” 
EU door open; UK door ajar .. 
What Next👇Will negotiations continue or not? 
#Brexit
As the non-talking continues, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and UK’s chief negotiator David Frost scheduled to *make phone contact*again today -2pm BST #Brexit
Are #Brexit trade negotiations with the EU REALLY over? 
Some thoughts from me: https://t.co/W2Eva9x51M
No10 announces EU offer to intensify talks+start work on legal texts isn’t enough-yet-to re/start talks. 
No10 spokesman said”the UK continues to believe there is no basis to resume talks unless there is a fundamental change of approach from the EU.” 
The 2 sides will stay in touch
