Michael Meyers also has the best argument for “get the hell out of my house and stay out” that anyone has ever seen.
I’m always amazed at how adept Michael Myers is at finding the power source to cut off the lights. 
Phone too. 
Never fails. 
Dude just knows the grids.

Worried about the federal TX stuff tomorrow though. 
It just never ends.
Fingers crossed indeed. 
Hope that scrambling bends towards real justice
Can only hope. 
This is all such madness

And hope they keep adding up to be enough.

I thought the camera angle in the Maryland/Minnesota game was pretty awful, but then I forgot about having to look at those god-awful Terrapin helmets all that time. 
My lord, those helmets are a crime.
Timeless.
