When the world leaves a scar on you 
#superbloom
I’m tempted to get this!
Follow your gut, follow your intuition.
If we spend our lives dependent on other people, how do we become ourselves? 
If you feel trapped in a situation, you feel trapped in a relationship, you feel trapped in your own life....this song is for you to feel in your bones what’s right.
This era of personal fashion was so relaxed and cool. 
I remember everyone used to dress like this to come to our shows. 
I’m now reminded of mikes “IDIOT” brand on the flannel T’s. Iconic
Thank you for watching #superbloomfilm2020 💚

SUPERBLOOM: A LIVE CONCERT FILM. 
Tomorrow at 6pm ET.
It’s all you!!!
Omg, this is absolutely spectacular. 
You have an incredible gift
I view it this way. 
All of you have given me/us the most wonderful rare opportunity to make music for a living. 
So imma go as hard as I can for as long as I can to raise my personal bar to the next level! 
It’s my responsibility to deliver with passion!
Kinda dude
I really got into my influences in this interview, diving into where my inspiration came from during writing Superbloom, maybe some artists you didn’t expect
Yeah, I wanna learn how to not work all the time
The best influence is be un-influenced. 
Be careful what your mind consumes. 
And make sure you’re not stressed. 
Stress will ruin the process
This is a tricky question. 
My main role in 5SOS isn’t really vocals. 
I work a lot on the visuals, the lyrics, the way the songs sound, and how to build a team behind the scenes to do things the best they can be
Maybe when the band settled down! 
I would’ve been on tour all year this year. 
So probably no such thing as Superbloom without the pandemic
It’s a guitar Viola and it’s one of matts strong points as a composer. 
He’s the mastermind behind the orchestration
Nope! This is all of them. 
There was a song called “Glass” that matt composed but I never wrote melody or lyrics to it
Superbloom has many definitions to me. 
Mainly, I’ve begun living my true path, and not hiding from myself! 
I’m blossoming into the man I am in a truthful way
Felt really natural this process cause there isn’t any other writers to enforce their wants and needs from the music. 
I made an album in a cohesive way, without outside influence. 
So it happened really naturally
I don’t think so! 
Who knows...
My end goal is to continue on a creative song writing path for as long as people listen!
Head voice *
I do pretty intense vocal lessons, but have been training vocally since I was 17! 
This record was an awesome learning experience thought cause I got into a bunch of different vocal techniques I hadn’t focused on before! 
Linking chest to hear voice and doubling a lot of tracks!
I know right. 
I’m sorry everyone! 
One day maybe if my music does well! 💕🙏❤️
No more music videos for this record. 
Since I’m independently doing this, I don’t have enough budget for another video right now!
No idea, when Im with the band in the studio again, we’ll explore all kinds of genres I’m sure. 
Gotta come back with some HEAT
I really went for a grunge sound that I love. 
I’m so stoked you vibe with it. This song is an epic one for sure!
It’s funny but, I saw this a couple days ago. 
And pondered for a while on its shape and color. 
Superbloom really is a vortex like this. 
Every album in its own way is. 
It transports you, mind, and spirit to a totally different frame of mind
I really liked Vivarium. 
It’s a cool twist on multidimensional beings that can hide amongst our 3D reality!
A beautiful song about the frustrations of media consumption and how depressed, confused and inhuman it can make you feel.
You will overcome all of this. thank you for being human and real with us! 
We can create a positive community of support and growth if we all show each other love and respect.
Well I appreciate the encouragement. 
This made me feel really happy. 
Thank you for really listening in to the details!
Thank you, I let go of a lot of pre conceived notions I had about lyrics and songwriting on this record. 
I just made something that’s “me” and honest. 
Superbloom is everything (almost) I love about alternative pop rock!
We could tie another knot between us and some hope.
The merch is made to elevate your vibration and everyone around you! 
Looks beautiful! 
Thank you for getting a shirt 💚
