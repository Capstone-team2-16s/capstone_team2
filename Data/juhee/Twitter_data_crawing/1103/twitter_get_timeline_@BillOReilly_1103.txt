My analysis has President Trump slightly ahead of Joe Biden tonight. 
I run down all 50 states on the No Spin News this evening. 
http://BillOReilly.com has it.
One of the reasons I will be happy if President @realDonaldTrump wins - the media will be so completely embarrassed and maybe the corruption of the entire industry will be exposed.
Joe Biden is a corrupt, weak man who is fronting a subversive movement that will crush traditional Americans.

Just saw a Corgi in a Toyota commercial. 
I am available for commercial opportunities. 
Not enough snacks at http://BillOReilly.com.
If President Trump does win re-election, I think some civic groups should sue the polling companies for fraud.  
They would most likely lose, but discovery might show many interesting and perhaps corrupt things in the polling world.
Been up since six getting election info. 
Both sides are nervous.

First election prediction: 
because of California, Joe Biden will win the popular vote.  
But Donald Trump will win perhaps 70 percent of the nation’s counties.

My take is Mr. Trump is showing strength in the final week. 
Mr. Biden is not.
