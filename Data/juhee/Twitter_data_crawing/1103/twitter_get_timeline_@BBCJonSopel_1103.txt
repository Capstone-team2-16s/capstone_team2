My blog on what is going to happen in this election. 
And it is crystal clear
#Election2020
Thanks for saying so. 
And thanks for teaching this really important stuff to your students, with such obvious enthusiasm. 
Great that you do
good luck to you all...
let's compare notes afterwards...
maybe over a glass of something that has an amber colour 
My work is complete. 
In this extraordinary campaign I have come across my first #labradonald at the @realDonaldTrump rally in 
#Scranton 
#Election2020
I think his outfit is a bit 2016 tbh. 
#BuildTheWall 
#Scranton 
#Election2020
Kind of interesting - and maybe sad - that the Elders thought it was necessary to put this tweet out
#Election2020
Understand @WhiteHouse is planning for @realDonaldTrump to hold indoor party for approx 400 guests in East Room on election night
#COVID19 
#Election2020
I am done. Toast. 
Finished. It‚Äôs over. 
I give up now. 
She is the future. 
I am the past. 
This is who @huwbbc and @sophieraworth should be putting on the news tonight
#Election2020 
#thestarsarealigned
America‚Äôs top  infectious disease expert who has served 6 presidents now in the political cross-hairs and a slogan at @realDonaldTrump rallies. 
How he must hate that his lifesaving work has become politicised 
#Election2020
Lol
This could be a big selling Christmas game....
Normally in back row, three seats in...
Glad I packed warm clothes for @realDonaldTrump rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania today. 
Brrr ü•∂ 
#Election2020
Latest polling from Pennsylvania, the key battleground in this election.
@realDonaldTrump held 4 rallies here on Saturday, and has another today. 
@JoeBiden is holding 3 events in the state today. 
#Election2020
A question I can‚Äôt believe hasn‚Äôt been raised: 
if @MichelleObama is the greatest asset the Democrats have - popular, respected, able to reach parts of electorate others struggle with - 
why has she been invisible these last 4 weeks? 
Not a single rally or event
#2020Election
Thank you Cathryn. 
I think we could wish for no greater compliment...but 18 episodes??? 
You need to get out more
Is that good or bad? 
Actually don‚Äôt answer. 
I think I can tell you‚Äôre from the wrong bit of N London
Am trying...but failing
Is that just a case of a ref who couldn‚Äôt bear to admit that he made the wrong decision? 
Incredible #COYS
From the pool reporter travelling with @KamalaHarris just now - was there ever a venue more aptly named for covering a lengthy presidential election campaign?
#Election2020
Thanks so much....
Fine piece of writing by the brilliant @maureendowd on what she ses at stake in this election 
Am I really not allowed to deploy an eye roll emoji here? 
Final key state polls now from @nytimes and Siena College. 
Similarly optimistic to yesterday‚Äôs CNN polls. 
If you‚Äôre the @JoeBiden camp you are going to dare to dream
#Election2020
So interesting....
‚ÄòThat‚Äôs what i do,‚Äô says @BarackObama as he drains a three-pointer 
#Election2020 
#toocoolforschool
I should have added, but sure you know this, these are all states @realDonaldTrump won in 2016
Final set of state polls from @CNNPolitics just released. Biden at 50% or higher in all four is significant.
#Election2020
While UK focuses on #Lockdown2 update on US: 
Nearly 100k infections yesterday - one day record
Deaths have topped 230k
47 states are seeing cases surging
16 states have cases at all time high
No new measures though
#Election2020
Oy. Watch it...
üòâ
I am. 
But feeling the pain for my family and friends and everyone who‚Äôll be affected so harshly
Admire your multitasking skills of balancing - and almost simultaneous - tweets on #LIVWHU and #Lockdown2
What. A. Dismal. Saturday. 
#Lockdown2
#sopeldidntgetany
???
This is nuts. 
This is the only place where mass audience events are happening in the US
Greatly saddened about death of #SeanConnery. 
A little bit of Sopel family history: 
My first cousin Carol had been engaged to him in the 1950s after they'd appeared in South Pacific together - but cos he wasn't Jewish it had to end, causing her great pain. 
#differenttimes
Fascinating but surely wrong. 
Neither party is behaving as though the numbers are anything like this in PA or FLA
#Election2020
If you want a really clear read on @JoeBiden path to victory on Tuesday and the different routes he can take, and what @realDonaldTrump needs to do to maintain power this is v good #Election2020
Thank you Frances. Exactly. 
I go and pick Maitlis up from the airport and Anthony gets the Revels
Thanks Phil. 
Like Arnie in Terminator ‚Äòwe‚Äôll be back....‚Äô
A doctor writes....
Sure. Wasn‚Äôt making comparison. 
Difference is that @EmmanuelMacron isn‚Äôt facing a general election in four days time. 
@realDonaldTrump is
üôè- and couldn‚Äôt agree more re Hugh. 
Lovely man too
Were they any good? 
Asking for a friend....
Made my day too. 
Definite name check soon for the 10 year old - and an Americast pencil (if we had such a thing...)
‚ÄòWill no one rid me of this troublesome doctor...‚Äô
Sorry to bang on about Texas - but more people have voted early in the Lone Star state than the total who cast a ballot in 2016. 
That either suggests polling stations are going to have their quietest day ever on Tuesday, or turnout is going to smash 2016's levels
#Election2020
Hard to overstate how closely @realDonaldTrump follows the Dow, and sees its rise and fall as a barometer of the US economy. 
These numbers will really hurt
Not what @realDonaldTrump would have scripted for final week of the campaign:
Coronavirus cases soaring to record highs, with deaths rising
The Dow having its worst week since March
#Election2020

This is interesting...so @realDonaldTrump more likeable than he was four years ago - but for @JoeBiden, more likeable and it's the % that are likely voters that  Dems will find most encouraging
Thank you James- so kind of you to say so. 
Have a good weekend
Fair enough
Forgot to say, there‚Äôs a bonus additional bit at the end of #Americast - after the music - that‚Äôs worth the price of admission alone. 
@WilfredFrost on the podcast he‚Äôs doing of his father‚Äôs famous interviews - got to listen to clip of Joe Biden from 1987. Uncanny
Bruce. 
I owe you an apology. 
If you are running five miles in a little over half an hour, then I am humbled....
Just seen you said 5 miles. I‚Äôm going to shut up now ü§´
Bruce - don‚Äôt want to be rude mate, but how long do you need for a 5k? 
@maitlis and I saunter round 5k in around 20 mins ü§• (if I‚Äôm allowed a cheeky emoji üò≥)
When a candidate tweets about what they‚Äôre NOT going to do doesn‚Äôt it look defensive? 
Doesn‚Äôt it suggest the @realDonaldTrump attacks are hitting the target?
#Election2020
What? Not another #Americast??  
Next you‚Äôll be saying it‚Äôs with those same clowns @maitlis @awzurcher and Sopel‚Ä¶
wasn't she great? 
And Ryan the week before who'd decided on Trump, equally interesting and compelling
Aside from the content of this tweet, which requires a bit of unpacking (If Biden wins, it's because of my Supreme Court?)...look at the time it was sent - 02.57.
Oooh. Good question!
This is incredible from Texas. 
Total of 8.5 million people voted in the state in 2016 
Early voting so far  is just 400k shy of that - and five days to go til polling day. 
#Elections2020
üò≥
If you ever wanted a fast rebranding exercise that would shout 'UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT' this is it
#Corbyn
#TheBoss takes on The Donald. 
But this time four years ago he played for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia, and that didn't do a whole lot. 
Do interventions like this make any difference? 
#Election2020
‚ÄúWith the fake news, everything is #COVID19, Covid, Covid, Covid,‚Äù says @realDonaldTrump - it's rounding the turn, it's going away. 
And here's America's lead infectious disease expert. 
Has there ever been such a jarring disjunction between politics and science? 
#Election2020
Something went wrong STEVE....
Aah. Thanks Kate üòâ
Thanks Gareth...
I think the production team on the doc did a phenomenal job
Steve. 
Appreciate it
Thanks Simon...
Great question. 
There was concerted effort to change in 1960s - but it requires a constitutional amendment. 
And threshold is high for that. 
And although there was strong bipartisan support it was filibustered by 3 segregationist senators from the South
Thanks Sam....
Hi Jazz. 
No!  
We‚Äôll be back on Friday....
That‚Äôs me, @Maitlis and @awzurcher for you - latest episode available now of  #Americast 
wow...Colonel Mustard, with the lead piping, in the library? 
is another way of putting it
@Maquaver I‚Äôm hearing you....
I‚Äôd take Wednesday, and then if no resolution throw a sicky on Thursday. 
And if it goes on for weeks, you may have to quit your job üòâ
My report from #Georgia on state of the race for #Election2020 
Listen carefully to the band as Joe Biden comes onto stage....
Haha. A pleasure Sima. 
There‚Äôs a subliminal bit of Midnight Train to Georgia on the Ten in a few mins....so you can play that later #neverknowinglyundercliched
This is fascinating. 
Tell me why you think it i‚Ä¶ https://t.co/eXd7aQJnGg
For dessert....
Yep. 
And they‚Äôre really not.....
I did on the road four years ago at a drag racing event. 
Never again
That‚Äôs dinner sorted 
#Georgia
Aah that is a lovely thing to write Nina. 
Most of what I scribble is pure nonsense....congrats on getting the business gig on @BBCBreakfast
Statement from @realDonaldTrump campaign on @JoeBiden campaign stop here in Georgia....
It‚Äôs always the third party candidates that cause confusion 
#Election2020
US has reported 500,000 new cases in past week
And numbers admitted to hospital are up 15% in last week
#COVID19
Thanks for retweeting a photo I took two years ago
Amazing there have been any constitutional amendments give how high the bar is set for getting them passed...
And now at dusk
üôè
Off beam. 
The  single Storey building is where the briefing room is, which in turn,  is built on what was the indoor swimming pool. 
At the back is the famous colonnade. 
This building links the East and West wing. 
See below....
Perfect autumn evening @WhiteHouse - what a privilege it is to do this job (mostly...)
I saw you mention Maitlis and me. 
I saw you mention Maitlis and me. 
I saw you saying what utter beauty...and I put two and two together. 
You were talking about us, right?
