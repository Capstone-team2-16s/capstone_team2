Today's show-@hughhewitt on the choice between security &amp; freedom, @AndrewYang on modernizing SCOTUS and why @JoeBiden is a "really nice wet blanket" & pollster @RobertCahaly on the increase he's seeing among the black vote for Trump
I think it’s more disaffected GOP women &amp; non-woke Dem women.
Maybe he’s thinking of those same suburban women we were just discussing
Sweet baby. She an angel!
Disagree. 
Many women see what’s being done to kids in far-Left schools (race &amp; gender shaming, “sex ed” that’s more like soft core porn, teaching the “100 genders” canard, openly saying parents’ rights end at school doors, etc) & come back to the GOP, whether pro Trump or not.

I was just going to vote for Heath!
Classic @scrowder⁩ ...and I love the hug at the end... 
Take it up w/Jimmy Fallon, Joy Behar, Jimmy Kimmel, Robert Downey Jr.,Ted Danson, Sarah Silverman, Justin Trudeau, Julianne Hough... 
I could go on but why bother? 
Ur dishonest click bait headline only chose me (who has never worn BF) so ppl might actually read your shitty pub.
Happens around this time every four years. 
Then folks calm down and are nicer.
Cool. Start by unfollowing me or you look a bit hypocritical. Ciao.
Look over here! Something shiny!
This made me &amp; @DougBrunt lol.
100% right.
Our 7-year-old: “Were you alive when Abraham Lincoln was alive?” Oh, honey.
One late night my husband @DougBrunt &amp; I went to @ComedyCellarUSA , &amp; I met @coldxman. 
I was getting beaten up by the media, & he sat me down & helped me make sense of this crazy world. 
He’s brilliant, thoughtful...& sets an example I aspire to follow. 
Thx for having me Coleman!
Today's show-@JamesRosenTV's suspicions on why Philly protests didn't spread nationwide. 
@kimKBaltimore takes on hypocrisy of "The View" and criticism that she's a "camera-ready Black woman." 
Plus pollster @DouglasESchoen on 1st thing he'll look for Tues
THREAD 
Exactly. It used to be we could celebrate a jurist’s ascension to the Supreme Court out of decency and love of country, no matter who appointed them. 
@girlscouts apparently wishes to change that in a surrender to the worst political bullies on the Left.
This is pathetic @girlscouts. 
It’s not “partisan” to generically congratulate the 5th woman ever to join the High Court. 
It’s patriotic. 
Taking your tweet down *is* partisan, however, and a real disappointment.
Can’t remember
My head hurts.
An AMAZING couple!! Love you guys!
The show is doing amazingly well - thanks to you! 
Come see what all the excitement is about...
He’s got all the signs of lying that Phil Houston highlights in his book “Spy the Lie:” 
(1) doesn’t just say “no”-he deflects w/“oh that old parlor game” & (2) *convincing* behavior-“I only wear a mask for 2 reasons...” 
Truth wld sound more clear & simple.
Miles Taylor should have stuck with his previous moniker. 
Now he bores me.
It is, so you shouldn’t.
You are gonna LOVE this interview w/ @piersmorgan on cancel culture, victim culture, what it’s like to get fired & smeared by the dishonest press ... & the benefits of—the occasional—spectacular failure.
I wonder if this will be a national story on every news channel for the next few days &amp; if @joerogan will be on the cover of the tabloids as “World’s Most Hated Dad”? 
I heard that happened once. 
Could be wrong.
Take a minute to see what these “protests” have become &amp; who they hurt - 9x out of 10 it’s hard working minority business owners. 
One of the many reasons why the support for BLM has plummeted.
Oh but Gerald, I’m not a conservative and never have been. 
Not a lib. 
Just a fair reporter. 
Try to understand: not everyone is agenda-driven.
Correct
Hello, this was sarcasm
For people who don’t understand sarcasm, umm, this is it. ⬇️ https://t.co/9OBPwNWJkb
Stop with all the facts and reason, @larryelder.
I know, I did it on my pod today and thought: 🤬
The fact that you don’t care to understand *why* these folks felt the need to loot is further evidence of said systemic racism.
I’m going to guess more intentionally dishonest than stupid, but either way, @sunny is embarrassingly wrong about the Supreme Court. 
As usual. (Remember: this is a woman still clinging to the “hands up don’t shoot” lie.) 
Good for @bariweiss
I will call her whatever I damn well please, and ACB sounds perfect. 
In an attempt to be the anti-Trump, they removed all the people, danger ... and fun.
I’m a proud supporter of military members. 
They defend us.
Now we must protect them.
The AP reports in 2020 - Army suicides are up 30% / Overall military suicides are up about 20%. 
Asking the right questions can save a life.

She was RADIANT!!
Oh good God I think you’re right. 🤦‍♀️
Thank you for listening and I love being part of your ladies night! 
An amazing day celebrating a beautiful couple! 
You will love Chloe and this discussion!
In today's show I talk with @cvaldary about her Theory of Enchantment - a practice of compassionate anti-racism. 
When your company tells you to listen to Robin DiAngelo, propose Chloe's program instead.

Father Beck! 
This reminds me of the time my nana told me she was making a novena for me and I thought it was an afghan blanket. 
40 years later, I get it.
This is the main reason to enjoy wearing a mask.
