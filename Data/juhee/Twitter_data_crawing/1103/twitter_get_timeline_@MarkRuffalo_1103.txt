THANK YOU, @AOC, @sunrisemvmt 
Saint James. 
It‚Äôs insane, unjust and ludicrous. 
No cops, no clubs, no mace, no rubber bullets, no tear gas, no arrests. 
Just a bunch of dudes with severe inferiority complexes  hiding behind their pick up trucks protesting fair elections.  
Not a Good look. SMDH.
Rounded the corner face first into a GD brick wall.

@realDonaldTrump quit your whining. 
We will know the winner when every vote is counted. 
Just like before you came around. 
I know you are new to all this.
#CrazyUncleTrump shouting at Fox News again.
A lot of people are saying it.
We all think it‚Äôs terrible that we got a president who lost the popular vote and brags about molesting women. 
So...tough üí©

Bernie says, ‚ÄúVote Him Out!‚Äù 
Love this kid!
I just made a donation to MJ for Texas to help elect MJ to the U.S. Senate! 
Give a little. 
MJ can beat Cornyn with his fake Oxford University claims, and his virgin ears(No offense to Virgins).
Uncle Bernie says #VoteBidenHarris!
This is a great video.
There is a whole world out there. 
Let‚Äôs not forget the people in #Belarus struggling for freedom against a fascist take over.
Covid is for real. 
Zuckerburg still Toying with our Democracy. Break FB. 
Facebook is still putting out fires amid searing accusations of partisan bias and negligence. 
Assembling the family for a Halloween family costume = Incredible!¬†

I love seeing these smashing costumes you're wearing today üíö

Has there ever been a more incredible spiral into lunacy then the one Rudy Giuliani has taken? 
It's astounding.

Good luck to @TaraMZrinski ! 
We need more people elected to statehouses across this country who care more about our kids' future than lining their pockets with corporate cash.

Yes! Get the money grabbers out of your pockets! 
Banking for the People. 
We should call these women, ‚Äú#ThePeoplesSquad‚Äù because every single thing they do is on behalf of us. 
Not big corporations. 
Thank you @AOC and @RashidaTlaib.
#onlytheyoung, we have just begun.

I know the list is long of Trump Administration lawlessness but we do well by always being outraged by it. 
#CrookedTrump
Damn @Facebook why are you spreading and amplifying lies and misinformation? 
This is beyond explanation. 
These people truly are evil. 
To knowing, willfully separate children from their families with the intent of them never reuniting is a crime against humanity. 
Vote them out and bring them to justice. 
Vote for the kids.
