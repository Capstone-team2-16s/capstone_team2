I’m so excited to introduce the new KKW X KRIS candle, a beautiful scent for the home inspired by our best selling @KKWFRAGRANCE collaboration that we launched earlier this year. 
The gorgeous scent really fills a room and is designed to compliment any home.

My mom &amp; MJ bonding time during quarantine is so cute
My mom is so cute for getting us all together on a zoom lunch during quarantine
BIG FACTS 
It was so hard at first but we figured it out 🙏🏼
I remember when Kanye and Khloé was tested positive for covid. 
So scary to hear #KUWTK
Bonding time with the kids 🤍 
#KUWTK
Have a good night!
I hope you have the best vacation ✨ 
We were so terrified for Khloé 😔 
#KUWTK
FACTS
🤣🤣 
I did a few times! 
It was hard in the beginning but our film crew guided us through it all ✨ 
Did you guys ever imagine us filming on iPhones?
Yes! 
The thought of a lockdown terrified me 
#KUWTK
I’m here early! 
I can’t wait to live tweet with you guys tonight ✨
5 minutes until the new episode of #KUWTK
I can’t even describe what this meant to me and my sisters, my brother, my mom and closest friends to experience together. 
Thank you so much Kanye for this memory that will last a lifetime ✨ 
Here’s a more close up view to see the incredible detail.
For my birthday, Kanye got me the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime. 
A special surprise from heaven. 
A hologram of my dad. ✨🤍 
It is so lifelike! 
We watched it over and over, filled with emotion.

Watch my full tutorial now on my IGTV
I love the feedback we have been receiving from our bigger vials of the nude glosses, so we’re also relaunching our concealers in bigger vials and introducing four new shades to our KKW Concealer collection!
Our new corrector collection comes in four peach and orange hued shades that work to eliminate that darker under-eye color. 
This is my first step in my concealer routine no matter what kind of look I’m going for, I really can’t do glam without it.
I’m excited to announce that we’re relaunching our @kkwbeauty Concealer Kits with an added first step: Correct, Conceal, Bake and Brighten! 
I have dark under-eye circles that can get really blue and purple when I’m tired, so my secret weapon to cover them up is with a corrector.

Now that I have your attention...this a reminder to VOTE. 6 days. 
☀️ Girls just wanna have sun ☀️
We danced, rode bikes, swam near whales, kayaked, watched a movie on the beach and so much more. 
I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now, so in moments like these, I am humbly reminded of how privileged my life is. 
#thisis40
After 2 weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were normal just for a brief moment in time.
Before COVID, I don’t think any of us truly appreciated what a simple luxury it was to be able to travel and be together with family and friends in a safe environment.
For my birthday this year, I couldn’t think of a better way to spend it than with some of the people who have helped shaped me into the woman I am today
40 and feeling so humbled and blessed. 
There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when we are all reminded of the things that truly matter.
COMING SOON: New @SKIMS Solutionwear™ styles! 
Our game changing shapewear collection is getting a major update:
