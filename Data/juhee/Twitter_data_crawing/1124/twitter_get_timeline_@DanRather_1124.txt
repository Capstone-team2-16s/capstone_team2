Competence is the new cool.
Thank you for sharing. 
This means a lot to me to hear this. 
Bless her. 
Can a science experiment be beautiful? 
This short film tells the remarkable story of two researchers who furthered human knowledge about the basic building blocks of life in an experiment many called " the most beautiful experiment."
As names of Biden's cabinet choices start leaking out, it seems his approach to staffing his administration will be a tad different from his predecessor’s. 
Experience and proven competence instead of nepotism and sycophancy.
Meanwhile in our heartbreaking reality. 
We can and need to come together as a nation by staying distant and wearing masks. 
A vaccine is coming. Hold on.
Talk about overstaying your welcome. 
The party’s over, buddy.
They won’t wear masks, but they’ll wear tinfoil hats. 
Not the best of looks.
Our documentary #HumanNatureFilm  on #Netflix ? 
We’re pretty proud of it. 
Thanksgiving 2020 was always going to be a disappointment. 
Help people live to celebrate in 2021. 
Stay home. 
Stay masked. 
Stay distant. 
Stay smart. 
Stay responsible. 
Stay alive.
Thank you. 
That was our hope with how we made #HumanNatureFilm. 
As we approach holiday shopping season (maybe many are already in it?) 
please remember Indie Bookstores are GREAT local businesses that need our support. 
Ask them for gift suggestions (even if it's not #WhatUnitesUs - sorry for the shameless plug). #IndiesFirst
Republican election officials have show a lot more backbone and commitment to democracy than Republican senators.
I remember when @HillaryClinton refused to concede and then the @BarackObama team refused to work with the incoming Trump team or meet with him. 
Oh right. None of that happened.
Nero fiddled. Trump golfed.
Completely on brand. 
Yes #Science  IS amazing. 
And awe inspiring. And fascinating. And vital. And urgent. 
Thanks for watching #HumanNatureFilm. 
It’s important to show there is a market for science films.
So glad you liked #HumanNatureFilm   Especially considering your experience. 
Thank you for your interest.
Congratulations. Thank you. 
A loss for science. 
A loss for Puerto Rico. 
A loss for us all.
For all the lights and cameras, the people on TV are still... people. 
A reminder of that tonight with a raw and poignant plea by Rachel Maddow. 
Do everything you can to not get this virus. 
Rachel, my thoughts are with you and Susan.
...since inflaming a deadly pandemic... since shaking down a foreign power for dirt on a political opponent... since ripping children away from their parents... since stoking overt racism around the legitimacy of his predecessor...
We are in the midst of a public roll call of which elected officials are willing to defend the laws and democratic practices of the United States - now and hereafter.
To all my Canadian friends who want to watch #HumanNatureFilm. 
The film is currently not available on Netflix in Canada, but is on Crave. 
Please spread the word to others who may be looking for it, and thank you for your interest.
I've gotten to know Emily Ramshaw @eramshaw and her efforts at @19thnews, a new national nonprofit newsroom at the intersection of gender, politics and policy. 
I hope you follow their great journalism, and join me in throwing $19 their way:
I love this. 
Learning and science can be a tasty treat.
We've postponed SO MANY THINGS this year, can we please postpone family gatherings for THANKSGIVING? 
To when we can be thankful for a vaccine? 
And science? 
And having saved the lives of thousands of our fellow Americans? 
Please. PLEASE. 
We’re close. 
We can get there. 
But not yet.
I love indie bookstores. #IndiesFirst 
Now just imagine if this election had ACTUALLY been close...
Truth. 
Thank you. 
This means a lot.
The answers will be what we all make of them. 
Our hope was to set a foundation for knowledge and dialogue. 
Thanks for watching #HumanNatureFilm  on #Netflix
I am extremely proud to support INDIE BOOKSTORES. 
Whether you’re buying #WhatUnitesUs or any other title, please support these vital local institutions.  #IndiesFirst. 
Spread the word and maybe share a shout out in the comments to your favorite local bookstore.
Wow! You can have an administration that reflects the diversity of America. 
Who knew?
It would be truly historic.
I remember the “Rudy” film as an inspirational story of a walk on football hero. 
The sequel “Rudy” playing out now in court is as if you fast forwarded 70 years and made it a tragic farce.
We need to live in a country that believes in counting every vote and not only those from people who would have been able to vote at the founding of this nation.
This. This is what COVID is really about. 
We need to hear these voices. 
This is a story that is hidden from sight for far too many. 
We need to break through the fog of confusion. 
Please read and share. 
Stop and assess.
The messaging, or lack thereof, on masks drives me nuts. 
I get it. 
Some people don’t want to wear masks. 
But we have no problem wearing the mantle of selfishness and stupidity
I completely agree. 
The biggest threat to our electoral process is the outrages that have followed a historic vote.
Those who make the system work are heroic patriots.
In my @RadioAndySXM broadcast, I want to hear from you. 
How is the pandemic affecting your plans for the holidays?
As COVID-19 cases rise, would you support more or less restrictions on businesses and activities?

My thoughts are with all in harm’s way tonight with another r horrific storm. 
We must act on climate change.
It all still amazes that humans are doing this out in space.  
He doesn’t even play a doctor on TV. 
Well, when you put it that way...
