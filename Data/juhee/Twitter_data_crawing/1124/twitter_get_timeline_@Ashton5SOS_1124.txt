Together we have amassed 1.5 million views of the most human performance I’ve ever been apart of.

Thanks for helping me learn lessons, and thank you for listening. 
Thank you for your kindness and thank you for helping promote Superbloom everywhere.

I feel like I did my part by writing it, so as far as I’m concerned my jobs done here 😂
Media outlets call us a boy band to bait our audience to get mentions and social media traffic. 
They know you guys will reply to it, That’s why they keep doing it. 🤷‍♂️
Thank you so much for this ❤️

When it comes to live music, we shouldn’t go without it for too long. 
It’s a part of our communities and a part of our soul's expression. 
When we dance and sing together we remember the beauty that shines through us being childlike and human.
And omg when the guitarists come in I was mind blown 🤯
This is so cheeky!!!!
This whole record is so incredibly creative and uniquely modern. 
Drawing from all the right shit! 
Congrats guys! 
Very Inspirational!
Hell yeah boys! 
Let’s get these gainz!!!
This is a beauty. 
Awesome style. 
Haven’t seen one like this before
Observe your reactions to everything!
Think vibrant and positive thoughts about the future. 
The manifestation of “2020 sucks” is dangerous for the future outcome of the world. 
Moving forward with intentional and “mindful” positivity will change the future of humankind.
Hehe
No way...... 🤯🤯🤯 
I think... incredible times for @5SOS apart from Michael running into pyrotechnics... that wasn’t incredible
Get SUPERBLOOM on vinyl now at @UrbanOutfitters 💚
Hehe I love the kitty cat
Love you!
It’s a great idea! 
With radio, you have to create relationships and travel to see local stations in order to get AirPlay. 
Since it’s a pandemic this would be difficult, so in order to currently get radio play, a song must gain its own momentum first on social media platforms! ❤️
Omg incredible. 
Please vote if you vibe with my drumming! ❤️❤️❤️
