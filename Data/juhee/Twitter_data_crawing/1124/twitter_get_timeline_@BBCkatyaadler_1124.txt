Huge congrats to you and team!!
Assumption EU-side is that if a deal will be reached, Boris Johnson will want it to be when -or just after-negotiating teams meet in London, rather than during a ‘Brussels week’. 
EU attitude is that bottom line: it wants a deal but not bothered how U.K. gov sells it at home

“Better to lockdown for longer than have to lockdown completely over Christmas” says CSU leader, Markus Söder, seen as possible future German Chancellor. 
Angela Merkel will announce next lockdown measures this week #coronavirus
Good thread on France and #covid .. 
Macron has similar dilemma to many leaders in Europe: 
lockdown means infections and hospitalisation are (slowly) reducing BUT do you open up for Christmas for economy/people’s well-being/political boost and risk a potential 3rd wave?? 👇👇
For all talk of 95% of deal being agreed, gaps remain on key outstanding issues: fish, competition regs +governance of the deal. 
Since mantra of talks is „nothing is agreed till everything is agreed“ this means if the 5% left isn’t successfully negotiated, then game over. 
#Brexit
After a briefing to member states on state of play in EU-U.K. negotiations, EU diplomat says: 
“Gaps are only slowly shrinking on core issues like level playing field, governance and fisheries.” 
Says there’s growing concern enough time left #Brexit
Notably a continental breakfast.. 👇 https://t.co/FHNjOLgqsb
EU-UK post #Brexit trade talks will continue despite the positive #coronavirus test result for a member of EU negotiating team. 
That individual, those in direct contact including chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier will self isolate but
EU chief negotiator Barnier may be in  self isolation after a member of his team got positive #covid result BUT tomorrow morning’s briefing for member states on state of play in negotiations with the UK will still go ahead - just not with Barnier #Brexit
The Barnier briefing of representatives of EU countries was scheduled for early tomorrow. 
Be interesting to see a) if it still takes place b) the tone of the briefing. 
Some member states leaning on Barnier not to do a deal *for the sake of it* or for the sake of his legacy..
Talk of #Brexit deal breakthrough: 
Handle with care! 
My thoughts:  https://t.co/We3i4u2OiE
EU leaders hold a summit by videoconference today to discuss #covid19 and the EU budget + recovery fund crisis (see below). 
#Brexit not officially on agenda but leaders expect an update on trade talks from European Commission President. 
Ursula von der Leyen
Much speculation (quelle surprise) as we hear EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to brief representatives of the 27 member states on Friday early morning .. 
Is a deal in the offing? 
Could it be announced this weekend? 
Early next week? 
#Brexit
Thread on differences between thin deal on the table and no deal at all with EU 👇👇👇 
I’d add police and judicial, social security cooperation  and UKs continued access to EU energy market to the list .. 
#Brexit
Which is why Austria is as of now in a far tighter lockdown - including school closures .. #coronavirus 
Fascinating thread on why Hungarian PM is seemingly willing to bloc EU funds to his own country in current stand-off over the new rule of law mechanism attached to EU budget 👇
Here follows a cautionary tale or two: 
Brexit agreements and the EU #coronavirus recovery fund - that illustrate the dangers of fudging contentious issues under pressure to seal a deal
