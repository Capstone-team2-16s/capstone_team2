God help me doing this here, but I’m writing something and wonder if you have any questions, however controversial, for me, not about me (but can be if entirely necessary.) 
I won’t answer them here or now, I’m just wondering what you wonder about?

Is there a petition?

Thoughts on the Crown season 4?
My podcast today is so good. 
I have  one of my Favourite writers and social justice commentators on the internet @yrfatfriend and she just killed it.

So much empathy and humanity. 
We should all be more like her.
He insists on being on my lap while I’m filming and I cannot concentrate and I’m dying of cuteness and nothing matters other than him and fuck filming. 
Fuck everything.
Bloody hell this woman and her clown of a boss 
I think women are trained to worry too much about what other people think about them.

It’s @theestallion world. 
We are just living in it.

Was asked to audition to be an amputee last week... responded that they should just audition actual amputees for the role. 
Was told that because she loses limbs over time they need a non amputee, but surely if you can make me look like an amputee=you can give someone prosthetics?
