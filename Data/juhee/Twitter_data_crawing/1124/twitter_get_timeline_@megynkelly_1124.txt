This. Was. Hysterical. 
And a great conversation all around with @RubinReport. Still laughing. 
Why is this up to ⁦@JaniceDean⁩? 
Where is the media? 
Gov’t watchdogs? 
The victims’ advocates hammering him for the FULL

Proud to be an American. 
Went to see this beauty this morning. 
She’s spectacular. And worth fighting for. 
Literally - omg 
It’s amazing! 
@DougBrunt has mixology talents! 
Here are the ingredients - equal parts tequila (jalapeño infused)/mezcal, a lot of fresh lime juice (he used one and a half limes for 2 drinks) and a dash of simple syrup. 
Happy Friday people.
@DougBrunt is trying to replicate a new (to me) tequila drink w/mezcal etc. that I recently had in a restaurant.
Me: “don’t worry, I have very low expectations and I know you’re going to exceed them.”
Him: “That doesn’t make any sense.”
This is why I married him.
Best actor?
In which @JamesCarville has a few words of warning for “The Squad.”
A really fun and in-depth interview about my new podcast @MegynKellyShow ... and life ... with @StevenEdginton &amp; yes, @piersmorgan, you will like this clip.
A great conversation and some good info on the Georgia Senate races. 
Thank you Governor! 
This was fun - @JoeTalkShow is a great interviewer! 
The guy infamous for mocking Trump voters as stupid losers who can’t read (on CNN) now says he *really* tried to reach out but just “cannot help ppl who refuse to help themselves...”-namely his “oppressors.” 
He warns: “don’t waste your time.” 
But, UNITY!
As usual @JoeConchaTV nails it: 
the Qs at Biden’s presser the other day “included questions that can't even be called softball, but more like T-ball when putting a beach ball on the tee.” 
Get used to it, he (accurately) warns.
There are many powerful, strong, smart women out there ... but there’s only one @Ayaan. 
Honored to know her. Enjoy...
Look at his indignation! 
At the suggestion that NYC schools might close on Thu. 
“You’re confused,” he says smugly. 
Right before NYC announces: 
School’s are closing on Thu. Gross.
Love this @MelissaAFrancis! 
To you, me, our guys and Elio’s and the many fun times to come. 💕💕💕
So sick of the sanctimonious lectures these folks give the plebes while they do whatever the hell they want. 
Remember when Newsom’s office advised ppl to WEAR THEIR MASKS B/TWN BITES while eating out??
“Disgraceful” Andrew Cuomo  says he’s “not going to allow New Yorkers to be bullied or abused.” 
NY Post w/the perfect response: “Only he gets to do that.”
I promised to transcribe what Prof. 
@GlennLoury said on the pod today &amp; here it is (though hearing it from him directly was so powerful). 
V. grateful we have people like Glenn who can articulate what we know in our hearts in such a compelling, stand-and-cheer kind of way.
THIS ⬇️. Free speech is not negotiable. https://t.co/zpbg7EEmw3
You really, really don’t want to miss this pod. 
Trust me.
Prof. @GlennLoury⁩: “Are u going to look [at] the U.S. as a racist, genocidal, white supremacist, illegitimate force? 
Or are u going to see it for what it is? 
Which is...the greatest force for human liberty on the planet? 
That’s worth fighting about!”
@JaniceDean mentioned on my podcast that she wished someone would do a clip showing how Gov. Cuomo blames everyone but himself for NY’s nursing home deaths (after *he* gave the order for Covid+ patients to be accepted in the homes). JD!
