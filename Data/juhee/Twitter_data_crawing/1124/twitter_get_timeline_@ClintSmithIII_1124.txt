right?! I only think I fully get it now
The Fresh Prince reunion episode really reminded me how central that show was for me coming up. 
So many memories. 
And at the end when the original Aunt Viv and the replacement Aunt Viv met *for the first time* and hugged each other I was about to turn into a puddle on the floor.
MLS playoffs are bananas
I wrote about how in 1864, Lincoln thought he might lose reelection, which could have led incoming Democrats to seek a peace treaty w/the Confederacy potentially keeping slavery in place for years to come. 
Luckily it didn’t come to that, but it could have.
I’m excited for her to read!
Also gotta say when I was a kid watching this I definitely was not hip to the commentary on racism/bigotry/otherness. 
When Cera’s dad wouldn’t let her play with Littlefoot because “three horns don’t play with long necks” I was like ohhh snap. 
Didn’t catch that back in 1994
just seeing that Tree Star again had me in my feelings
lowkey best character in the movie
Also Spike really held it down for the crew. 
My man didn’t say anything the whole movie but saved everybody’s life on multiple occasions and all he wanted in return was some leaves to eat. 
We love a humble stegosaurus king.
I am watching the original THE LAND BEFORE TIME movie for the first time in maybe twenty years and am deeply overwhelmed with nostalgia. 
Shout out to Little Foot. 
The hero we all needed.
Kyle’s poem is so good and so important. 
You should read it.
if only someone were writing a book on the subject 👀
There will never be a day when the death penalty is anything other than  utterly cruel and barbaric.
But this execution is made particularly horrific by the fact that Orlando Hall is the first person to be executed by a lame-duck administration in over one hundred years.
Well played
the more em dashes the better don't let anyone tell you differently
Really enjoyed this conversation. 
Over 1,500 people remain incarcerated in Louisiana because of non-unanimous jury convictions despite it having been deemed unconstitutional. 
It’s unacceptable. 
Grateful for the work of those trying to change it and bring those folks home.
Folks aren't ready for this one.

Looking forward to this event today at 1pm EST with @JusticesPromise discussing how over 1,500 people in Louisiana are still in prison because of non-unanimous jury convictions, a relic of Jim Crow.  
Event is free.

I can’t stop thinking about this video. 
Our government has failed on such a profound level. 
Just has outright failed millions and millions of people in ways we won’t even fully understand for years to come.
We've got to keep saying it every day, that fact that millions of people in this country live in poverty is a political choice and our government can make a different set of choices so that this is no longer the case.
“19th-century American politics were shaped as much by Black resistance to enslavement as by the institution of slavery itself.”
congrats, Rebecca!
Grateful for the men who are rejecting narrow conceptions of masculinity, who are constantly working to unlearn the way patriarchy has clouded how we walk through the world, who are committed to teaching their sons freer, more expansive lessons about what it means to be a man.

Can't say enough good things about this book.
