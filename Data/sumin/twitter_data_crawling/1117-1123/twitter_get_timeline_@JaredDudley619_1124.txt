Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to Mark Bartelstein from @PrioritySports !!
Declines the 34mil to add an 3 yrs 86 million! Sheesh! 👏🏼
There’s 15 spots on a NBA team, only one player max averages those number..
I’m talking to the young hoopers trying to make the NBA and stick...
Find your niche!
I hope all young hoopers at home are watching how the NBA is paying their players!
Only 1/2 stars per team so Defensive versatility (guarding multiple pos) and elite shooting gets you paid!
No one cares how many pts you avg anymore!
If you can make plays for others = cash out
Happy for him! Remember when he was trying to get back in the league working out at @impactbball !
Hard work pays off!
So happy for @joeharrisbball !!!!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 
Hope he gets the Max!!!!!!!
Facts!!!!! 😂😂😂
Almost time!!!! 🍿🍿🍿🍿
Facts! 🙏🏽
Can we stop playing and get Usher Vs Chris Brown????
Stop it!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Love this!
Should of never gave it back!!!!!!!
Getting on Zoom now! Little late
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
It can! Very rare! 8/10 leave in free agency!
You want to risk your job on that if your the GM?? 
I agree!
But you just make it known these are the only 2 or 3 teams you’ll play for...
No GM is mortgaging their team for a player that doesn’t want to be there..
Kawhi was a rarity and raps only had to give up Derozen and Poeltl ..
Nothing they can do...
NBA wanted to get rid for 7 year contracts, they felt players got paid and stop performing.
Shorter contracts means player empowerment.
Lastly a team can trade a franchise player anytime but a player can’t ask out?
