Watching ppl on trampolines on tiktok, gtg. 
feels like it’s every 75
It’s soooo long in between seasons I really forget about it whenever it’s on TV.
🤷‍♀️ I dunno I really don’t watch them if I’m being honest. 
Is trampoline a sport now? 
(Not a joke)
I crack my own self up mannnnn help!
Hahahaslslakzkanzka a 
Then why is your nose so far up my pussy tryna catch a whiff
Why didn’t you make a video for the others, y’all so mean lmao
Did anyone ever find a CD player for the remix or nah? Lol
I have no music I’m promoting right now...
I go thru phases where I have to eat pizza literally three times a week and then suddenly for months I don’t give a fucccckkk about it.
I’m sorry pizza. I do love you.
Times worth more than money.
The wildest part about “the crown” on nextflix is that the queen carried her purse around her house. 
Imagine having a house so big, you need to take a purse to the kitchen.
My son is my happiness. 💖
Thanks!
The fabric I’m using now has a bit more stretch in it than before so that the sizes have more ability to be a bit transitional.
Thankyou!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Yes I will NEVER sell you something that is just a money grab, I genuinely love designing and w😊creating products - it brings me joy to see you all happy and enjoying something I made. 💖
Ifight bts about both those things soooo hard for y’all you don’t even know!
I really really care that you can have something awesome and not have to have a lot of money to afford it.
Yes we didn’t give up, we troubleshooted until we found the perfect application and color balance and I’m so happy, knowing YOU will all be happy.
Great job to everyone on the merch team! Thankyou!
But finally we have cracked it!
They will be on the way to you all shortly! Woooooo!!!!! 
I may be late but bitch we will always always always give you what we promised!!!
I can’t even tell you how stressed I’ve been and how many times & samples it’s taken to get these damn hoodies to print and actually look like metal.
They kept just looking grey & I’ve been so worried because I hate to disappoint you when you’re always so happy with my merch! 1/2
Me and trixie are a little bit legenderic this week. 
💖🥰

I’ve actually made a lot of new friends this year and that’s always been very hard for me my whole life!
So I’m kinda proud of myself to be overcoming a bit of my social anxiety.
I spat my drink out
😹 
😩😹💀 
Hahaha 
Right!
Who’s gonna find a CD player first.... 
I will put it on streaming!
But wanted ppl to have the exclusive as a fun bonus.
No iTunes tho. 
💖
I know!
But it’s hard when you are signing thousands to have to pay such close attention to that so - 
Back was much easier and safer.
The remix is amazing has anyone heard it?!?!
I kept it on the CD and off iTunes so you had a lil exclusive
It was hard to sign and not write over either me or Tinashe because of the picture.
I would consider it disrespectful to sign my name over another artists picture, so I stuck to the back on most for this reasoning.
🥰 
I signed the inserts first this time and I’m so glad because I know you love collecting them & this way we can shrink wrap over and it’s always mint if you’re saving it. 🥰
🥰
What y’all eat for dinner?  
I had jam drop cookies
You passed over into the light. Now you’re at ✨peace✨ 
Hahaha no just my shitty social skills 
Same!
Girl no one I’m the asshole who ghosts.
It’s someone ghosts you and then texts you again out of the blue - 
That’s a haunting.
Hahaha I alreadyyyyy knew
No💖
Hahaha and shark boy too hahahaha why are all my nicknames always animals 💀
Hahahaha!
Who talkin shit about me now, lemme find outttt!
Hahahaha 
My grandpa calls me stretch since I was little because I’m tall.
No because I feel names are very personal and I never wanted strangers to be able to use mine when talking shit and putting weirdo negative energy on it. 
Gotta protect your vibe.
Sometimes I call him puppy dog boy because he licks everything and crawls and is so cute like a lil puppy.
Hahahahahahahahaha
Yes a lot of people do actually.
He will call me mama! Period!
Even they call me iggy so that should let know know - 
It’s a VERY small number of people who call me by any other name.
We just know!
I dunno it’s weird! 
We just always know when it’s directed at him & when it’s directed at me.
Ppl think I speak in the third person all the time because they don’t know I’m referring to someone else with the same name.
No usually the 1% call me a mix of both names depending on who we are around etc. 
but if someone in the 99% me that then it’s like 👁👄👁
nahhhhhhhh not feelin thattttt
99% of the people in my life call me iggy & I prefer that except for the 1% that know me that well that it just hits different if they say my real name because it feels cozy.
Lol.
Exactly. Like I gotta KNOW you. 
Like you know my mama level, 
You know my deep dark secrets n shit.
Only a VERY select group of people in my life are allowed to call me Amethyst. 
If I let you call me that you are elite.
💖
Hahaha I could fed order them and show you my recommendations !
Oh for sure I will do that one after Christmas! 
What kind of Christmas video should I make? 
Christmas make up? Decorate a wreath? My ten favorite things about Christmas?
Ranking my best to worst gifts ever?
