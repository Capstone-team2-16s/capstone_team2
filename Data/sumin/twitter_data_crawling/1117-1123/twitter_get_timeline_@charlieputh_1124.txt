This is a weird thing to write on here but I don’t think I’ve ever been in love.
I’ve definitely been in lust but that’s not the same thing.
I don’t know why I can’t bring myself there, I know I can one day, it’s just always been so hard for me.
What im most excited for you to hear on this next album is the song I made with Elton John.
We wrote it in like...30 min! Lol @eltonofficial
Name something more fly than the bridge of ‘Cause I love you by Lenny Williams. Sheeesh
Gooooood morning

Ohhhh wow I remember that
I really really like you by Carly Rae Jepsen still holds the title for one of the best, most well put together, most massive pop bangers.
The most ridiculous melody ever written is the one in Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered.
Wet ass puthie
Wait until you hear this one... @sadgirlsloan 
I like that
You are so talented and you will always write massive, awe inspiring works of art that touch the hearts of millions of people.
You inspire me. Don’t worry
