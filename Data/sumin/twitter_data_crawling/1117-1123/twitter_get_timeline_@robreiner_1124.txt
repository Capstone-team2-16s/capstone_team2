Now that Trump has lost and will be facing Criminal Prosecution, we will be facing the unholy Trinity left in his wake: White Supremacists, The Selfish Greedy Rich and  Ignorant Truth Deniers.
If we stay engaged we will prevail.
After Trump leaves, and he will, to repair the damage he has caused Democracy, it will be imperative that a non partisan commission be formed to investigate him for Federal Crimes.
It will be the only way we can restore faith in our Constitution and the Rule of Law.
The projection of this mentally ill man continues.
An illegitimate tortured President pathetically tries to claim his successor is illegitimate.
If his insanity remains unchecked, it will do permanent damage to our Democracy.
I can’t stop looking at the dual rivulets of dye running down Rudy Giuliani’s cheeks and thinking, like the Wicked Witch, Trump’s defense along with his presidency is melting.
Elected Republican officials’ lives are being threatened. Americans are dying.
It’s time for Mitch McConnell to walk into the WH and tell this infantile lunatic to stop spreading lies and accept his loss.
ENOUGH OF YOUR CHILDISH CRAP!
PEOPLE ARE DYING!
STAND THE FUCK DOWN!!!
Donald Trump fires the head of Cyber Security at DHS for publicly stating the election was completely secure.
And the GOP just sits by and allows this sick lunatic to continue to destroy our Democracy.
Somebody anybody with an ounce of courage, Do Something!
The only fraud in this election was committed by Lindsay Graham.
The Republican Party is out of its collective fucking mind. And an accomplice to murder.
