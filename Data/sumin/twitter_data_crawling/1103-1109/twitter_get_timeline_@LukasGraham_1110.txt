2021🙏🔥🎶
Give him my best
Some days are just better than others
Sauna + ocean = serenity 
Do you want to get behind the scenes of my life the past 10 years?
This is it🔥🎶💚 and you can watch it in cinemas all over Denmark🇩🇰
Again where did you get this information?
Shit.
I don’t even trust my own creative process so how could I ever trust my closest friends and family.
I trust my instinct, my gut feeling, my heart.
The rush of Adrenalin when I write and or record something that makes me feel something.
When my blood pumps.
The moral of the story is: you can’t trust your friends and family because they want to protect you.
And you can’t trust people like me, because we don’t know you.
With luck: you have a few co-creators with whom to share ideas and feedback.
So trust and doubt yourself religiously
LITERALLY: Some of the people I trusted enough to play the demos of 7 years, love someone, happy home, not a damn thing changed, funeral etc.
thought the songs were not good enough to release even just as album songs.
To all the people trying to break through as singers/songwriters.
Stop asking for validation/feedback from people like me.
Honestly, my opinion matters as little as the next person.
Your heart knows when your stuff is good.
Be you, practice, work hard, rehearse. That’s it.
Today was a great day
No compliment😅
It’ll be on my next album in a different version😇
Stop the freemium model altogether.
🔥🎶💚🎶🔥
🙏🙏🙏💚
I never thought about it like that.
One of the reasons I never swear in my songs is I want my grandmother to not die when she hears em 😭
I’m also pro peace n ❤️ but the strife caused by the rhetoric is immensely huge.
😂😂❤️
No.
We’ve known each other my whole life and will most likely discuss this when we meet.
The whole idea of saying “the crazy rhetoric aside” is absolutely ludicrous.
Look at what the rhetoric creates... 🤯
😭😭😭
Is it available yet 🤞🙏

Where did you get that information?
No.
Bro, you need to get out of whatever bubble you have been creating.
Please.
You used to make sense and now it’s more like nonsense.
I was only referring to Trump calling voter fraud.
I’m aware that you have a completely different voting system compared to us in Denmark.
It’s sad that you have no trust in your countries democratic process😔 the same process that got your current president elected.
Yes 💚💚💚 all the way
Big features and ballads coming up!
Uplifting songs and strsight🔥🔥
What just happened in the US of A?🤯
Because... Albums🎶
😂😅😇 have a great day💚
🙏🙏🙏
Where you grew up and where you're from will always have a big part to play in terms of where you end up.
It's all about making the best of it regardless of the adversity you face.
“Where I’m From” will be available on all music services on Thursday, Nov. 5th 🧡
