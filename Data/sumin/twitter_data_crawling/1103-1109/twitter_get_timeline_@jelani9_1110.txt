Wow.
I teach in a journalism school and would never ever encourage a student to do this.
Yep. I learned this in school!
Wouldn’t be a bargain if it wasn’t!
It’s Hardwood Wednesday so 15% off. 
What? It was an honest mistake!
You know it.
How’d you know?
No, journalism.
Why would it be about refurbishment?
I went to high school about a block off utopia.
👍🏾
Shares the same parking lot as a matter of fact.
Great options right next door.
So you know the place? Good.
See you Wednesday.
Next door — how’d you know?
We’re in luck.
John “The King of Hardwoods” Billingsley is going to do an in-class presentation.
I have to issue a correction: Wednesday’s class will *not* meet at Columbia University. 
We will meet at the Columbia Flooring and Drywall Outlet on Utopia Parkway in Queens.
Apologies for any confusion this may have caused.
Brilliant.
For him.
Correction: we will be meeting at that landscaping place next to the porn joint, across from the crematorium.
You know the area — the one where nobody actually goes if their GPS is working properly. 
See you Wednesday.
Students in my class: please note that in light of the election we will be meeting *in person* this week.
Class will be held in the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia.
Would not at all be surprised if he walks off the job.
Just issues a bunch of pardons then splits in  the middle of the night and hides out in Florida until Biden is inaugurated.
It’s not the first time a plot line from Veep showed up in this administration
Joe is AMPED.
Ran all the way to the podium and speaking like a preacher trying to pay off the sanctuary.
“The African American community always had my back and I’ll have yours.” 
That line is going to be repeated regularly for the next four years.
Noted that Kamala Harris didn’t even feign civility with the standard “I’d like to thank our opponents for a hard fought and spirited campaign.”
Was basically like “I won’t even insult y’all like that.”
I’ve thought about this some.
2008 was joy. 2020 was relief. 
Dead wrong. 😂
Spelman College to Howard University be like
#howardu #spelman
Frederick Douglass Circle, Harlem USA. 
YOU KNOW!!!
Two words for yall: Howard. University.
Democracy.
Thinking of John Lewis, John McCain, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the many others who did not live long enough to see this man defeated but whose memory helped make it happen.
YES!!!!
Yep.
At some point the refusal to call it based on projections starts looking like deference to 45.
Definitely didn’t see this one coming. 
Bahahahaha
Wondering if no Republican state wants to be the one to put Biden over the top and thereby incur Orange’s wrath.
He bragged that he told people to stop the testing during a pandemic.
Can’t really be a shock that he tried to stop the counting during an election.
Do we need to run down the list of democratically elected leaders that the US toppled, destabilized president killed?
There’s a prospect of a defeated Trump being even *more* antagonistic toward the pandemic crisis measures.
This as we’re heading into the worst months.
The inauguration will take place amid the darkest stretch of the crisis.
Statler & Waldorf.
Those are the names of the two elderly hecklers in the balcony on the Muppet Show. 
Also, the model for what Donald Trump’s role in public life will look like for the next four years.
Really need to stop reflexively referring to the President as “the leader of the free world.”
We don’t know how these “non-white” voters you’re juxtaposing against “progressive intellectuals” drew their conclusions.
But it would be smart to start by asking if Biden’s 1994 crime bill and Trump’s First Step Act muddied the waters Re who is the racist in the race.
It was always a dumb supposition because it assumed that a person couldn’t vote for Trump while opposed to his racism because they *really really* disliked Hillary Clinton, the historically unpopular democratic nominee.
Moreover, the point that connects this to the silly fixation with Obama/Trump voters was the reflexive attempt to diminish the role racism plays in Trump’s support — something that social science has pointed to consistently.
The holes in the argument are apparent but if you’d like I’ll point them out.
1. When you say “non-white” voters you’re talking about a category so broad as to be useless.
But let’s presume you mean blacks and Hispanics.
You’re also assuming they only vote on racism.
But that’s not what sparked the interest in that population in 2016 and you know it.
This is the 2020 version of “what about the people who voted for Obama and then switched to Trump?” 
The 15th Amendment, which gave black men the vote, was ratified 150 years ago.
It was hoped that black voters would offset the political power of racist whites who’d nearly destroyed the country.
A century and a half later it’s doing the same thing.
To be black in the first week of November 2020 is to feel that you’ve been called off the bench, yet again, and told the whole game is on your shoulders.
I mean... technically someone called it two days ago it’s just that nobody believes him.
Yep.
That’s why I remember it.
Election reminds me of what Sugar Ray Leonard said after his first fight with Roberto Duran: “I threw my best, he threw his best.”
Reporter: What landed? 
Leonard: Everything.
True. Perot.
If there’s any question about how demoralizing this situation is, even if Biden wins, the last one-term POTUS was Bush in 92. 
He was done in by a tax hike and a recession.
45 has a recession, a pandemic, racism, corruption & a decade without paying taxes. And it’s *this* close.
Yeah. On Howard’s campus no less.
No but I just bought those same dumbbells.
Been there.
Actually about to go back there today.
Curious about what kinds of home workout spaces people — especially New Yorkers — have created since the pandemic as I sit here trying to gerrymander a fitness area into my NYC apartment.
No but you can start one and call yourselves The Endnotes.
Would be too poetic if the late John Lewis’s former district was what sent 45 packing. 
#ATL 
#GoodTrouble 
#thebesttrouble
Exactly.
No.
He was just in over his head.
No.
But he understood the rules of one game and naively thought that meant he could win at a whole other game.
This year is the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment & the 150th of the 15th Amendment.
Right now the hopes for American democracy hinge upon black women — a population that needed *both* those amendments (and a Voting Rights Act) to get the right to vote in the first place.
Same night???
ATL come through.
Seeing the way Cube, Wayne  and 50 played themselves reminds me of Stringer Bell trying to be a real estate mogul.
If Georgia puts Biden-Harris over the top the administration and everyone who voted for it will be indebted to Stacey Abrams for an idea she had a decade ago. 
Here’s my profile of her from last year.
Taking suggestions for the Fulton County vote soundtrack.
Fulton County votes about to show up like 
It’s in the next tweet. 😥
Again.
The future of American democracy depends right now on what black people in the hoods across the country did yesterday.
That thing about this election being dangerous and there being a threat of violence? 
We’re about to enter that part.
We can debate about a lot of abrupt changes in the GOP on trade, deficits, immigration, etc but the most stunning has been their complete reversal on national defense and sovereignty. 
At least the Cold Warriors knew when the country was being undermined.
Absolutely stunning to me that a person with this record of abject failure and a quarter of a million dead Americans strewn in the background could not only retain support but benefit from a surge in voting.
No matter how this turns out we are in deep trouble collectively.
😂
That was one of the strongest arguments made in Biden’s behalf tbh.
Science is increasingly worried that the virus will become endemic, a persistent threat to our lives.
We should have the same concerns about the chaotic forces of Trumpism, even if — maybe especially if — their principal suffers a crushing defeat tonight.
Endgame.
Black = radical
Hahahaha.
Now it’s time to have that conversation every parent dreads: “Son, there’s something called the electoral college...”
Ray Charles, James Brown — Georgia.
Heading into the final round with no idea what’s really on the scorecards.
How you feeling?
Ok, it’s 3pm on the east coast.
Plus it’s daylight savings time so *really* 4pm.
And this anxiety has made every day at least an hour longer so we can round up to 5pm.
Whatcha drinking?
Cool.
We’ll spot you 157 years.
Let’s talk about the fugitive slave and slave trade clauses of the Constitution, the gag rule, the Trail of Tears, secession, the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Slaughterhouse Cases, Tulsa in 1921...
Do you know any of this? There’s more.
