Donâ€™t forget about the calming power of awe.
Try not to label or analyze.
Just be with it, in awe.
No you didnâ€™t.
You lost.
Mark â€˜Not Controlling the Pandemicâ€™ Meadows AND Matt â€˜Gas Maskâ€™ Gaetz both test positive for Covid????
Wow. Just wow. The timing is stunning. 
Also, when I typed in â€˜gaetzâ€™, I swear on everything, my autocorrect changed it to â€˜fartsâ€™.

Friendly reminder that @ASP has a lot of helpful information :)
This is a man who served his country over his ego.
He praised our treasured institutions over his own party.
He was an example of leadership even in defeat.
He tried to bring us together while accepting his toughest political loss because he knew what truly made us great.
WATCH!
Damn. I love @StephenAtHome 
Thank you for this. 
Every single Republican needs to watch this. https://t.co/305KjB7t1O
Wow.
Hey Republicans, are you listening to this come-to-life toilet spew complete lies about the integrity of our democratic process?
Love this guy
