The longer Trump refuses to accept reality, the more pathetic he becomes.
I almost feel bad for him. Almost.
We finally have a President who is human, decent, and loving.
A strong man who will restore the Soul of our Nation.
God love Joe Biden.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Joseph R. Biden will be the 46th President of the United States.
Democracy will survive.
Ding Dong the Witch is dead.
Trump is throwing up all this legal garbage to prevent Joe Biden from claiming the Presidency.
A fool’s errand executed by a fool.
Joe Biden will be our 46th President.
President Biden. Sounds good.
No more hand wringing.
Joe Biden will be our next President.
It is time to Save Democracy.
It is time to Save Lives.
It is time to Vote for Joe.
It is time.
Trump will try anything and everything to keep US from voting.
It won’t work.
The Truth is Marching On.
