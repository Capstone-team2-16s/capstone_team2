What are ur sens??
I’m 800dpi, 0.285. ... but I play inverted 😋
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
Of course it’s not Anthony.
The work is just starting.
But with a President who isn’t racist and xenophobe himself the work CAN start.
THAT was (in my opinion quite obviously) my point...
I’d hope you agree with that?
No! Of course not.
Didn’t say that either lol.
What’s better about postmates?
I’ve historically only used postmates but people tell me uberEATS is better.
Whats the diff ?
No. But the end is going to start now!
UberEATS or Postmates?
TIME TO HEAL
Correct.
Yes

nah
I’m talking about the President. Not the world.
And to the ones who say I didn’t respect Trump:
Correct.
I didn’t respect him and I never will. 
Respect isn’t given. Respect is earned.
*complimentary. Nothing is free in life ;)
Ok bruh but I love it.
I looooove it. :)))))
wish i could explain better how much but just ... max level love it
If you are unhappy with the outcome of this election I’m sorry for your anger.
Trust me.
I know the feeling.
I’ve felt it for 4 years.
Correct.
Sorry I didn’t have the old patch notes on me.
But yes correct- it went down 100% because over the last four years we were experimenting with very high numbers
It’s the patch notes bro.
We’re monitoring the stability of the game.
Our devs have been hard at work.
Give it a chance.
Play v46.1 a bit more - we think it runs really smooth
True.
But today I celebrate.
So... join me or leave!
That’s wrong, Donny. 
You’re the red bar, not the blue bar. 
Your name is NOT Joe Biden.
You are “Trump”- the one with “MILLIONS AND MILLIONS” of votes LESS. 😋
AMERICA got a huge buff today.
Patch notes below:
• dignity: +100%
• racism: -100% 
• introduced new feature called “science”
• removed “lying” from the game as it felt too effective
• added a tool called “hope” to ramp up character moral 
• made “future” a bit brighter
Hey @realDonaldTrump:
YOU’RE FIRED!!!
CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA 🇺🇸!
CONGRATULATIONS WORLD 🌎!
CONGRATULATIONS HUMANITY 🧬!
I LOVE YOU BERNIE!!!
What “legacy” is she referring to?
The one from a parallel universe I assume?
He did not. 
You however actually did, you lunatic 🤡!
Just let it be and save your money to defend yourself from going to jail for your remaining days.
U can lie all you want like you have been for 4 years but democracy is going to grab you right by the pussy.
Meet u there
Correct. I have enough.
I can give more.
My own interest isn’t my first interest.
I want to live in a country with dignity and a President who isn’t a lying sack of obesity. 
So, yes.
I’m happy to pay more taxes in exchange for everyone doing better.

Actual decent human beings with a brain don’t believe it. His fans do.

I don’t care if he’s Democratic or Republican either.

The only constant in my life is that my protein shake has 240 calories.
I JUST watched it.
Thought it was a really good speech!
I forgot what it feels like to not be embarrassed every time the president speaks.
FINALLY we’re on the same page.
we all want fraudulent votes to be discarded so that trump doesn’t cheat his way into office. :)))))
