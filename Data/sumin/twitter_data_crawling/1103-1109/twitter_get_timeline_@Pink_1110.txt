What a momentous day!!!!!
Yeah Donny, but not enough.
This news has brought me to tears.
I was overwhelmed with relief for this country.
I was overwhelmed for Kamala and the inspiration that she brings to girls everywhere.
Van Jones made me cry ugly tears.
This country has so much work to do to come together.
I pray we can do it. ❤
Hahahaha NOPE
That’s right, we did our part.
#EveryVoteCounts & it’s time to wait for democracy to deliver.
We're in this together.
