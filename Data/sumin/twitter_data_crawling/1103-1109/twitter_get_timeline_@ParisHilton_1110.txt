Happy Birthday to the iconic #HelloKitty! 🌈🌈👑😻👑🌈🌈
She was made of fairy dust. ✨
Her mind as fragile as fairy wings. ⚡️
Her eyes as bright as the twinkling stars. 💫
And a heart of gold to match. ✨✨🧚🏻‍♀️✨✨
Loves it 🥰

🎵”With you, I feel the other half of my heartbeat, I'm complete
In you, I hear the other half of my heartbeat, that's all I need.
I didn't know what I was missing.
Oh, since we've been kissing.
I can feel the other half of my heartbeat.
It's so sweet lying here with you.” 🎵😍😍
Mr. & Mrs. Aquarius 1st Halloween together🥰 ✨✨👸🏼🤴🏻✨✨
