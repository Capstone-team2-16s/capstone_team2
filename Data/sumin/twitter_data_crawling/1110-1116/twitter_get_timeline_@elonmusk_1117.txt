@flcnhvy Yeah, with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls
The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other
Dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety https://t.co/Mr7VFIQwWf
Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety https://t.co/KrOHKOr6AE
