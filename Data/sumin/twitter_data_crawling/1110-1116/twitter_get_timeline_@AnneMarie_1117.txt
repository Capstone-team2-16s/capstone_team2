I didn’t know ham burgers didn’t have a slice of ham in there.
They really are elite
I feel bad that I’ve never appreciated sheer black tights enough.
ALEXA, play PROBLEMS by Anne-Marie!!!!! 🙌 
I feel this.
Im also insensitive to natural light so it doesn’t wake me up.
I’ve tried everything.
And I have ADD, I’m hyper aware and dyslexia which really does not help my sleep.
Am I alone in this? Lol
Btw this is real.
My body clock is 26 hours. It’s a thing.
Read about it.
It sucks to try and live on a 24 hour one.
Can we all just get over the whole waking up early thing?! I can’t do it, I’ve tried my whole life do it and never have been/will be able to.
My body clock is just different and I’m sick of trying to adjust to whoever made 24 hours the rule.
OH MYYYY GODDDD YESSSSSSS
