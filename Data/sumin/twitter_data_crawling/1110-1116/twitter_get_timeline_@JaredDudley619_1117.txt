I agree!
Love this...
Wonder why governors would sign off on it?
If you can fly on a crowded airplane with your mask on you should be able to go to NBA games with one on right??? (Limited capacity)
Respect to Pat Riley...
Most if not all GMs don’t do this...
UD value is so high even without playing!
Respect to the OG 🙏🏼 last of a dying breed
Facts!
Makes sense...

No thank you! Thanks for the New Xbox!! 🔥🔥🔥 
I’m looking for the X...
You live in LA??
I’m hearing that similar for the NBA..
Travel in Phx or Sac play them 2 times in a row to cut down on the traveling…
It’s not an advantage..
All teams play the same back to backs and same amount of games..
For those 8 teams you can make the schedule less taxing early and backload those games late... more rest early for those teams that played later..
This is true for the teams that made it to the 2nd round and beyond..
Teams will have to be careful with the ramp up in training camp and the first 4/6 weeks of the season...
NBA should look out for those teams schedule wise early in the yr.
Ok who’s got the connect for the New Xbox coming out tomorrow?????
