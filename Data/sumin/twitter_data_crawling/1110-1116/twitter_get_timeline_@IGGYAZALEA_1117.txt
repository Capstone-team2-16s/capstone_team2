Babies sleep in weird ass positions, 
Your back don’t hurt bro?
😝
I don’t wanna “become a YouTuber” just think it could be fun to post videos from time to time that are not music related.
Def gonna do it! But probably in 2021 since this year is cursed. 💖
Wow this is really cute, I love it 😻
Any other moms who can’t stop dropping weight after having a baby?
(Not a brag, genuinely wanna hear if you had this happen) 
I don’t try/want to lose weight but it’s literally just shedding off me, is it hormonal?
Should I be concerned? 20lbs lighter than pre baby and counting
💖
Bro I was ready!
2020 I came to fight!
Literally!
I got half the procedure right but then driving home I realized I forgot a really important step that could’ve made our situation so much better.
Like bitch!!!
I could’ve saved our lives way better! 
But it’s hard to remember what to do in emergencies when they are happening.
You forget stuff that’s simple.
FUCK! At least it wasn’t real life. 😹😩🥴
you can count on me to kinda safe a life.
I have moderately good ideas.
So I thought I was in a life or death emergency today (long story, I’ll explain later, I wasn’t)
I was happy I got a lot of the safety procedure correct - but then driving home I realized I forgot the BIGGEST part/first thing I’m meant to do. 
And now I’m kicking myself! Argh!
Facts! 👁👄👁
