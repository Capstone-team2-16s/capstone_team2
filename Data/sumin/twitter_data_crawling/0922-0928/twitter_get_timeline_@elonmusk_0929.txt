Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries!
For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing!
Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics.

Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow.
This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.
We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG & CATL (possibly other partners too).
However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 & beyond unless we also take action ourselves.
The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood.
It’s 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes.
The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.
