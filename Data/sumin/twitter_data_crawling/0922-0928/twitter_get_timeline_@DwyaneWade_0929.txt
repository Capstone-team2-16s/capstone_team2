😂😂 We call this a win/win but it’s #HeatNation over here!
‼‼‼‼‼‼‼
BIG FACE COFFEE FOR EVERYONE haha on Jimmy tho
Tyler and Bam for the next 10 years can be special
Iam so fucking happy for Jimmy right now
Let’s go BAM!!!! Let’s go!!!
Exactly how this game should be.
It’s hard to get to the finals and it’s even harder to win a championship.
So if you’re gonna do either of these you have to know you can win these kinda games.
Iggy!!!!👌🏾s
😂😂😂
Ethan tell her I’m out there in spirit
I know Coach Spo isn’t happy about giving up that corner 3 so much in that quarter.
Especially in the zone.
You can’t keep giving up that corner shot
Iggy knows what to do to help this young team get over this hump.
He has to take those shots and shoot them with confidence.
I know the coaches has him shooting those same shots before and after practices.
Leave it!
Let your work do your talking kid.
Keep going
Two things that will make this a great Sunday @ChicagoBears Comeback Win ✅ @MiamiHEAT Win....???
Another one! Congrts to my brotha @KingJames on his 10th final appearance.
What we’re witnessing will never be replicated again.
🤷🏾‍♂️@DWadeCellars
Happy Birthday to the living legend himself @ScottiePippen

Love how AD shook off that ankle injury.
Perfectly Said...
It’s about being apart of something bigger than you.
We want that same legacy that the Lakers and Celtics have.
3 Championship is only the starter kit to that.
#Heatlifer #HeatNation #WadeCountyforever
😂😂😂 this is the best thing I’ve heard all day
I’m 😭 😭 😭 Twitter Caption with Video of the year!
He’s Special!
Y’all know Jimmy thinks he’s a Wide Receiver
Get the ball in 👶🏼 🐐 hands and let’s go home aka back to the hotel room
Or Scott Foster
You can’t just call fouls refs
Bam just need some Robitussin after the game he’ll be fine
Ohh that’s heat ball Scott Foster
What I love about what Herro Ball is doing...
We all know this isn’t just a hot game.
This is how he plays the game of basketball
Wow
Listen if someone told me I would have an awful first half but a big second half I’m taking it.
Vs having a big first half and an awful 2nd half.
Tatum showing how mentally strong his is.
It was a great record while it lasted 😆
Don’t show them everything Herro ball sheesh
Dear Breonna,
I’m so sorry the people in power have failed to get this right.
You deserve so much more.
Your life mattered.
You deserved the bright future that was ahead of you.
We will continue to say your name.
We will continue to fight in your name.
#BreonnaTaylor
Not a pretty first half but we will take it.
It’s been moments where the Heat offensive has gotten to its strengths and other moments has looked random.
More getting to strengths in 2nd half pls
Tyler Herro definitely got a black best friend
This is gonna be a good game.
Both teams came to play.
I like this Heat team right here.
If we get this focus all all game we’re gonna be hard to beat
I love the body language of Jimmy to start
Built Different
Thank you brother🖤
