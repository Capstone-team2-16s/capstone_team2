Fun fact 2: now that you've listened to Clarissa's kick-ass lead vocals, I can tell you that I'm on a quest to unearth the version of this album with my lead vocals and will not stop until we find it! So happy that we get to experience this together lol! 🐑❤🎸
I can't 😂😂😂😂
I'm so happy yet thoroughly amused that my little "alternative"/"grunge" album is finally out there for the fans 😂
Rock on!!! 🎸🎸🎸🎸
Fun fact: I did an alternative album while I was making Daydream 👀
