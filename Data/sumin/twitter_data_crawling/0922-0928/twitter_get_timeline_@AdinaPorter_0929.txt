So proud to have been a part of that series, #Underground  
Bravo #LovecraftCounty
Who is nervous about #The100 series finale?
Indra has been “stress eating.” 🤣
Watched a wonderful documentary #CakesOfVersailles about using modern day creativity to honor Versailles.
And — like Versailles also see the decadence & inhumanity that lead to its demise.
Got my creative juices flowing!
Thanks @IFCFilms
Watching National Geographic’s “Magic of Disney’s Animal Kingdom. 
Disney Conservation Fund (DCF), inspired by Walt Disney’s conservation legacy helps protect wildlife & wild places around the world.
We are fascinated...and...pizza 🍕!
Sending out a BIG Congrats to #BillieLourd and #AustenRydell on the new arrival!
Very happy news. 🤗❤️🍾🎉
Is it unintentional? 😉
Giving this a boost.
There are probably a lot of #The100 fans who will enjoy it.
Thanks @McKenzieLyn , Fandomize and my cast mates.
#MayWeVoteAgain 
Time to check the homework.
Thanks for watching #The100 with me.
👆🏾more left. Wow! 
Later, 🐊’s.
I had a few “difficult” scenes in True Blood (for personal reasons.) AHS — you’ve ALWAYS gotta bring your A game.
And — The Newroom because that’s the nature of Sorkin dialogue.
It’s fairly normal to have different directors for different episodes — on most shows.
Now that I have your attention, could everyone (in the United States) please, please, please VOTE. 🗳
Make a plan to vote.
And make a backup plan to vote.
Then do it!
Ian Samoil did a wonderful job directing that episode.
I’m so grateful I was able to shadow him. 🤗
#The100
Something in S3 or one of the scenes in S7.
Gosh, @MisElizaJane has me crying again.
@iamAvgeropoulos too!
#The100
A very elite, celebrity chef.
#The100
Most? Hmm.
I liked that Indra was a different type character than I usually play — in a genre — I have never done before #The100 .
She would have succeeded in her real estate development business.
#The100
🤣 Then I’ve had many lives!
Indra would simply nod.
I, on the other hand, feel very happy to read this and want to say “Thank you.”
(See...we are different.)
Where is the jackhammer for goodness sakes?!
#The100
Mr. Blankenclear. In fact, I almost forgot about him.
#The100
Honestly, it’s been a rough day.
I love this young lady.
#The100
“West coast” (in America) means all the states in the U.S. that border the Pacific ocean. 
Does anyone have questions that don’t involve favorites?
#The100
🤣 No way!
That’s definitely a stretch.
Some “Bhagavad Gita” vibes in that discussion.
#The100
Oh I really liked that @Gap commercial during #The100 .
The soup is ready. 🥣
#The100 is on and I cannot spill my soup.
New #The100 is on !
So is the soup 🥣.
I’ll be watching at 8 PM Pacific Time.
Wanted to thank Director Ian Samoil for allowing me to shadow him during his episode and for being a great teacher!😘
Just heard the news about #BreonnaTaylor .
It physically pains me so I cannot imagine how difficult it was for her family to hear.
