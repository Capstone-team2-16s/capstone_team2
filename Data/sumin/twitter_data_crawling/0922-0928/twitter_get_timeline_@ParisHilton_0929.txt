Never be afraid to use your voice for honesty, truth and compassion against injustice, lying and greed.
If people all over the world would do this, it would change the earth. ❤

Thank you all so much for the love & support of my new film #ThisIsParis. 🎥
I’m so proud to use my voice and my platform to raise awareness on what happens in the troubled teen industry.

😍 Thank you love ☺️
Thank you🥺 I appreciate that❤️
I don’t want to burn anything.
But I would love to shut them down because that’s what they deserve.
And thank you I’m so happy you enjoyed my documentary. 🙏 #breakingcodesilence
So incredibly proud to have shared my story and truth in #ThisIsParis 🎥
I want to thank you all for your outpour of love and support.
I was so scared and did not know what to expect having never been so open and real in my entire life.
My new mission in life is to do everything in my power to shut these places down so that no other child has to go through what we went through.
And I hope by telling my story can help you heal, tell your story and set yourself free.
We can no longer be silent.
It’s time to expose them and protect the next generation.
Love you all❤ #BreakingCodeSilence 🖤

Is there anything she can’t handle?
She’s been broken. She’s been knocked down.
She’s felt the pain that most couldn’t handle.
She looks fear in the face. She never hides.
And she always finds a way to get back up. She’s a #Warrior. 🖤
