Trump could easily prove the NYT story is a hoax.
Just show his taxes.
Of course he won’t do it because he’s a Lying Criminal.
Not to mention a compromised National Security threat and a pathetic excuse for a human being.
President Donald Capone.
The fact that a sitting President would lose, not accept the outcome of the election and resist the peaceful transfer of power is so insane that...
oh fuck, just Vote Him Out.
VOTE HIM OUT! VOTE HIM OUT! VOTE HIM OUT!!
We’ve been in a Constitutional Crisis for 4 years.
Not hyperbole.
In 40 days we will either still be a Democracy or be destroyed by a Fascist Sociopath.
Trump is actively using all the levers of government to steal the election.
He knows he’s gonna lose, so he’ll do anything, including tampering with electors to throw the results into question in hopes that his newly constituted SC will save him.
We can stop this crime. VOTE!
The more than 200,000 who have been killed are not nobodies.
The man who continues to kill them is.
Donald Trump has essentially shot and killed 100s of thousands Americans on 5th Ave, continues to do it every day, and he’s right, his cult doesn’t care.
But the rest of US do. In 42 days we will arrest the killer.
I’m sick and tired of Dems wringing their hands over GOP hypocrisy.
And stop saying all options are on the table.
Say what the options are!
And don’t threaten them, promise you will do them!
The question is: Will the Dems play hardball?
If they don’t they will be surrendering to the minority.
