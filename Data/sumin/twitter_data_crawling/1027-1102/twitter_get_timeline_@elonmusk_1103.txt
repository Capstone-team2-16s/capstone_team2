I could not be more excited about the new supercollider!
That said, while it is considerably larger, I don’t think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering.
Sure, maybe in a month or so
Well, it’s basically a tank from the future that’s road-legal, so yeah
Tesla Texas team is making great progress! Giga Texas factory will be an asskicker.
Yes
Penguin Random House 😴 should change the name to Random Penguin🔥
Sure, although it might be quite a short livestream!
Lot can go wrong, but we’ll provide video, warts & all.
You will see every frame that we do.
This is what matters most
We’ve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass
Lord of the …
Yeah.
Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.
Minor
Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch, yaw & roll during descent, such that the ship is positioned well to relight, flip & land, would be a big win
But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible.
Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready.
Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great.
Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks & relight would be a major win.
Every 5 to 10 days
Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions.
Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments.
True for most beta releases in my experience.
Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard!
Doing “neural nets” without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they’re doing.
Reality is the hardest sim.
Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too.
This build should be noticeably better with interventions
Yes
I’ve spent more than half my life in California & love the state.
But, frankly, I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem. 
Like a sports team with many championships, it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency & a sense of entitlement.
And … Sweden is still right with zero deaths Oct 29
True.
Also, fewer heart attacks, as way easier to pump blood in 37% gravity.
Now we’re talking.
Also, Stephenson 2-18 is in the constellation Scrotum haha.
Small fry.
The sun converts over 4 million tons of mass to energy every second.
Accurate
Some challenges with high winds.
Looks like Sunday for static fire.
Great shot!
Future AI will appreciate this
Truth is stranger than fiction
😉
Urf is so smōl
For a long time
Truth be told, I’ve eaten at JitB many times over the years, even the teriyaki bowl
Might buy a Jack in the Box footstool
Approximately, log(rate)
Same bot, just change setting to “combat”
Well, being a phased array antenna, it is actually rather flat!
Tesla should make 🔥 catgirl robots?
Little crane: “Am I just a toy to you!?”
🤣🤣
Come here … no, come, here 👇
Wow, this mayo sure is salty!
Max Payne was great on many levels.
Silent Hill good too.
Jack in the Box should do double duty as a sperm donor clinic — name is 👌
One of the best games ever
FEAR 1 with modern graphics &amp; sound would rock
Ok :)
All games in this thread are far scarier & more creatively so than any horror movie
FEAR 2 is best imo. Also Dead Space 2.
They will haunt your dreams.
To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades.
Most of the factory had no equipment at all!
Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.
GM & Toyota took everything that worked & moved it to their other factories.
All that was left were broken bots & equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value.
But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots & brought the factory back to life.
And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left.
They took all good equipment & sold most of rest for scrap.
It looked apocalyptic inside.
Bettern nothin or ur 💰 back!
💫 🛰
Tesla team has done great work!
Well, tbh, our capex efficiency in 2017 was trash 😬
