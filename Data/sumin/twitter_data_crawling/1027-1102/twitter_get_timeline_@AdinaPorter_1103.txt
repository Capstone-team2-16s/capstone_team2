Is Red Crescent the best charity to donate money for victims of the #TurkeyEarthquake ? (I can’t read Turkish...)
Do you know of a legitimate place to donate money for the victims?
I’m seeing a lot of fake charities. #TurkeyEarthquake
I’m so sorry.
It looks absolutely awful in the news stories I’ve seen.
Turkey is definitely on my mind and in my heart.
Hope, prayers and condolences for the people of Turkey 🇹🇷 impacted by the earthquake. 
🙏🏾❤️
