Here’s a question from @MikeNiesz: "What's different about this election and voting?"
"Can you talk about how/why the stakes feel so much higher?"
@Glblctzn, what’s making 2020 different?
Let’s go @OffsetYRN🔥🔥🔥 #EveryVoteCounts 
My sister @Camilledmay asked, “Why is voting so important to you?”
Who wants to take that one first?
That opening was so powerful!!!

We asked people to send us their questions about voting using the hashtag #AskEveryVoteCounts.
Let’s share one now.
