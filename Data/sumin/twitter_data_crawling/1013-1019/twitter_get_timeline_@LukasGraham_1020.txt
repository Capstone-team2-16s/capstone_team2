Humbly looking at my values and actions to check my own ego and ambition.
A lot of people will never allow you to grow, simply because they’re not growing as much or as fast as you.
See, the problem isn’t you growing or them not growing, but the fact that you may outgrow them.
It’s tricky, I know, but it’s not your problem. It’s their problem.

Only the supposedly clever ones learn nothing because they are so sure of their own intelligence and superiority
You know what? I am a fool.
And proud to be one so that I can learn a little more.
