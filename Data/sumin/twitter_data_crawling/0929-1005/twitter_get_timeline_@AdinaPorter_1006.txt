Got an early preview of @Showtime ‘s #TheGoodLordBird .
It’s a series you’ll keep thinking about...always a good sign.
And it’s timely. Releases on Showtime - October 4th.
Check it out if you have the chance. 👍🏽
Negative.
They are not.
😘❤️ you!
Happy Birthday to everyone born in October! 🎂🍾🎁🎈🎉🛍
Ever since “she” lived in Switzerland and Africa.
😘 my friend.
I missed you, @ItsPaigeTurco ! ❤
Great scene with @linzzmorgan .
#The100
May we meet again, centipede 🐛 in another lifetime — perhaps — when we are both cats.
Okay, I’m paraphrasing VANILLA SKY.
Probably a sign for me to go to bed.

Short for Behind the scenes.
Honestly, I felt terrible for #The100 hair & makeup department, especially when it would rip in a battle or fight scene.
They really worked hard on it.
Hair story 8) Once I wrapped #OBXNetflix , it made much more sense to “buzz it all off.”
And that is the hair story of S7 #The100 .
Hair story 7) this was during the early episodes of #The100 S7 so it was hot & sometimes the bald cap would tear.
And we’d have to do it all over again.
Hair story 6) so everyday, this is what hair & makeup did to accommodate my hair needs.
#The100
Hair story 5) They’d start by making me a bald cap, painting it to match my skin and once dry, apply and glue hair pieces to the bald cap to match my S6 #The100 hair.
Hair story 4) Soooo...
The wonderful folks in #The100 ‘s hair and makeup department had to “build” my hair.
This consisted of many hours work — every day.
Hair story 3) This is normal.
Shows need continuity.
My #The100 hair was completely different from my hair in #OBXNetflix so it was an issue.
Hair story 2) #The100 needed my S7 hair to match my S6 hair.
#OBXnetflix needed my hair to match what it had looked like in previous episodes and scenes.
Thank you!!!! for all your hard work.
Hope we can work together soon.
Much Love
Hair story 1) I was shooting #OBXnetflix in South Carolina during the early episodes of S7 of #The100.
Hurricane hit in South Carolina which delayed our shooting schedule.
And now I owe you all the “hair story...” #The100

Nope.
We already broke the internet once.
Nope I’m still 🤐 on that.
Pretty sure you can figure out the show if you google.
Nope.
Yes.
Stay for a while.

Hair story will be told after #The100 finale ends on west coast, as promised.
Going to be hard to fit into one tweet.
New job has been delayed a bit.
Waiting for virus protocols to be implemented.
Everyone is working to keep cast & crew safe.
