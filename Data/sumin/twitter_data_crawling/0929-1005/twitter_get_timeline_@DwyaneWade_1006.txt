Talk yo sh*t JIMMY!!!!
The Heat are making the extra efforts.
Jimmy is bringing his teammates confidence.
This would be game 3 in Miami btw.
Each game is its on.
They have put themselves in the position to win/ now they have to finish.
Oh and Jimmy is a beast.
Say it louder for the idiots in the backseat
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I like that effort Miami.
Keep fighting and figuring It out.
Last of a dying breed
The one on the bench can’t be more angry than the ones of the court.
We need that same energy on the court.
You can’t spar with them and you won’t outplay the Lakers.
You have to fight, scrap and make it ugly to even have a chance
All we wanna see is some fight.
Let’s go.
Keep playing
I agree Big Perk
