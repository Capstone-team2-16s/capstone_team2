Provo Canyon School has faced allegations of abuse and mistreatment since its founding.
lt is time we demand accountability.
Provo along with the countless other facilities aren’t going to be able to get away with this anymore.
Thank you to my #Survivor Family for being so brave and courageous telling your stories to @InsideEdition.
We will no longer be silent. #UnitedWithOneVoice 🙌 #iSeeYouSurvivor #BreakingCodeSilence
One day you will tell your story of how you overcame what you went through and it will be someone else’s survival guide.❤️

Hi Thomas, thank you for the lovely message. 
Sending love ❤️ 
Happy Anniversary my love!
I feel like the luckiest girl in the world because I have you. 🥰
You opened my heart in ways I didn’t existed.
You are the most extraordinary person I’ve ever met.
You transformed my life in so many ways.
They need to be exposed &amp; held accountable for their deplorable actions.
Please email me at ThisIsParis@ParisHiltonEntertainment.com ❤️
Thank you all for your bravery and courageousness for coming forward.

Hello fellow survivors, parents, family members of survivors &amp; former &amp; current staff members.
My team & I are collecting information of stories of abuse that has happened & is still happening at these “schools” in the the #TroubledTeenIndustry.
Hey guys, I’m doing another #TikTok Live this week for my #ThatsHot Series. ❤️
Trying to decide which person I should do it with.
Any suggestions? 🤔
I will do everything in my power to shut these places down and stop the abuse of children.
But I need your help.

As traumatized children we always dreamed that someone would come and save us.
We never dreamed that it would, in fact, be ourselves, as adults. 🖤 #iSeeYouSurvivor #BreakingCodeSilence
