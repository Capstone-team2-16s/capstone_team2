It’s mind boggling that organizations don’t realize how key locker room/vets are.. @jj_redick touches on it.
You first need Talent, health, and chemistry.
The key to Chemistry is the vets.
It’s a Long season and you will go through ups and downs.
Vets and Culture are the 🔑

Lucky to have him with the Lakers
