Best of luck to the @modestgolf lads this week at the @ScottishOpen ! 
Thank you @VisitScotland & @ASInvestmentsUK for all your support of Ewen & Connor. 
Can’t wait to come back to Scotland soon
4 years since ‘This town’ !
Thank you all for the support ever since.
I’ve enjoyed the downtime of late as it’s given me a chance to re-evaluate things and live a half normal life for a bit.
hopefully the next stuff I release is my best yet, whenever it may be. X
