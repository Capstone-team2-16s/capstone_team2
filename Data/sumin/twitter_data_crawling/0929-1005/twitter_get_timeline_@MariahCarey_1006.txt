Thank you @amazonmusic !! 🙏🙏
Happy Anniversary Daydream 😍 🎵 and I lay in bed all night and I was...🎵 
My executive assistant at the time thought it was a "ditzy" title for an album.
I'm glad I didn't listen to her or the rest of the corporate morgue.
All I did at the time was daydream, sing and endure a lot of bleakness.
It remains one of my favorite albums to this day 💖
Cyndi, you have always had love from me!!!
I will never forget on my 21st birthday (back when I still had birthdays), when you gave me a beautiful orange lyric book and I wrote the entire Music Box album in it. It meant so much to me as do you and your talent! ❤️❤️❤️

Lambs - my family, I am so deeply moved by your reactions to #TMOMC.

Tune in to ‘The Meaning Of Mariah Carey: Looking In.
Narrating the audiobook for my memoir was such a special experience for me.
It not only brought me closer to the words on the page, but to some of my own song lyrics as well.
Laugh, cry and sing along with me as you're listening to #TMOMC 
Butterflies in my stomach but pride in my heart.
Tears of joy for little Mariah whose story gets to be heard for the first time. I've been waiting for today my entire life. #TMOMC 📖💝
Full blown tears at 2am 😭😭😭 thank you for always being #ThereForMe ❤️❤️❤️
“I refuse to acknowledge time...”
