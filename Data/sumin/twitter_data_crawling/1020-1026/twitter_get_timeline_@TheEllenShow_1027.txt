Happy birthday, @KatyPerry!
Sending love to you and my favorite girl, Daisy Ellen Bloom.
Can’t wait to see what happens tonight in the World Series, on at 8:08 ET on FOX!
It’s Game 4, the Dodgers are up 2-1, and it’s best of 7, so that means I have no idea, but go Dodgers!
Halloween is full of sweet treats, and @TheKalenAllen is learning how to bake this Irish fortunetelling cake.
Thinking of you and this sweater. Happy Birthday, @drake.
I don’t know how @CelineDion, @Adele, and @DollyParton all ended up inside of this woman’s body, but they did. @Rachel__Harper
We need more cowgirls.

This little girl and her Halloween costume are exactly what we all need to see today. 
I hope you got the wasabi under control.
