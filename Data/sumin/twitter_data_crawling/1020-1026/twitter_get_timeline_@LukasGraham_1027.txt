Facts brother💔
The new remix of "Share That Love" by @R3HAB is out now.

It's hard to fathom that it's been 5 years since "7 Years" was released worldwide😅
I can't thank you all enough for listening to the words that I write & the music we create🎶
Being able to keep doing what we do best is a blessing🙏 #Noaudiencenoshow 💛💙💜

I’ll be damned if I do it
Damn damned if I don’t...
Damn. I’m both😅
