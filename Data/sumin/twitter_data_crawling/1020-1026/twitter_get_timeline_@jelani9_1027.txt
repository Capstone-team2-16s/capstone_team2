Someone could make a great short film called “Early Vote” and just pull together scenes like this one and the people dancing online in Philly.
Fucking exhausted.
Yes
I def have that division.
Also shirts that are strictly for working out.
Wowww
👍🏾
Ah. I was thinking 12 but we’re in the same ballpark.
How many t-shirts should a middle aged man own?
Just became aware of @jennimonet’s Indigenously newsletter.
Such great coverage of Native American affairs.
Check it out here:
Wow.
I sometimes pass Grant’s Tomb when I go for walks around Harlem.
And when I do I always stop and take a moment to reflect on that.
We only need to look 3 years after Lincoln’s death to dismiss 45’s ridiculous “More for black people than anyone except maybe Lincoln” claim. 
Ulysses S. Grant opposed white terrorism and crushed the KKK.
And Orange is out here talking about “stand back and stand by.”
We spent a year tracing the elements of voter suppression in Wisconsin and their implications nationally and for the upcoming election.
Whose Vote Counts is now available on http://pbs.org
That one waitress at the Waffle House out in East Point.
Lol
Anyone who rented an apartment to a black family between 1974-1980.

Damn.

Ok, I’ll start: People who did more for black America than Donald Trump.

No, the problem is blackface.
Someone should follow up and ask “So what do you think Lincoln did for black people that you didn’t.”
In fairness the pandemic will also end “soon” so we won’t need the healthcare plan. 
That sound you hear is the gasp of shock as people learn that a former prosecutor is more liberal than an actual Democratic Socialist.
Malarkey!
Early rounds but if this were a boxing match I’d say the challenger is hitting the champ whenever he wants to and mixing up his punches.
“Americans don’t panic. He panics.”
Yeesh. #biden
Somebody backstage had Biden listening to “Ether” before he came out. @KeeangaYamahtta
Biden continues looking at the camera and talking to the audience — one of the best tactics from the first debate.
Trump focused on Biden, Biden focused on America. #thedebate
“His Democrat governors — they’re shut down so tight and they’re dying.”
We’ve now reached the Less American Parts of America part of tonight’s program.
“You are xenophobic but not because you closed down travel from China.” — Biden.
“People are learning to die with it. Learning to live with it? C’mon. We’re dying with it.”
Biden on Trump’s claim that we’re learning to live with the pandemic.
Long ago thought the whole “Biden is senile” line was a dumb strategy because eventually the incumbent was going to have to do exactly this: debate with someone who has a stronger command of facts on specific issues.
Yes. More than the number who fought for the colonies.
Pertinent question.
Also, who are the Trump voters who don’t vote at all in Harrison-Graham.
So wait, John Brown is wrong and George Washington is not?

This is about right.
I met Tom Steyer once, in Alabama.
We were on the line for grits at a hotel buffet. 
Was great working with you. So proud of this collaboration.
Thank you to everyone who watched Whose Vote Counts on PBS.
We spent a year working on this film, navigating a pandemic to continue filming because we thought it was a crucial story to tell.
If you missed it you can watch on http://pbs.org and YouTube.
None.
😂

Picked up my phone and saw that I got 65 text messages this afternoon. Odd.
