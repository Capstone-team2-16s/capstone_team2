For decades, @Rotary has worked tirelessly to #EndPolio.
Today, the health infrastructure they’ve built around the world is supporting the COVID-19 response. #WorldPolioDay
I’ve been working for some time on a book about what we need to do over the next decade to avoid a climate disaster.
I’m excited that it will be published on February 16.
It’s inspiring to see so much passion these days for dealing with climate change, and to know that the world has set some ambitious goals for solving it.
What we need now are practical plans to reach those goals.
India’s research and manufacturing capacity are critical for fighting COVID-19.
Thank you @narendramodi for speaking at today’s Grand Challenges meeting.
