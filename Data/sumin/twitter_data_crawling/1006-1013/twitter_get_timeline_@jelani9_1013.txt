But there’s a difference between an impersonal alarm and an actual human being banging on doors and yelling “fire!” in the middle of the night.
That’s a great reply.
I thought the same.
It was a real test of character to read this because of the competing impulses to be angry and judgmental
this thinking has killed tens of thousands of people, what’s wrong with you??? 
and to have empathy for someone who is suffering profoundly.
I could see that.
Really? Say more. I’m curious.
Wow.
Interestingly, this was 2002, not long after we did the Cruse book together.
The wall between the two apartments burned through and my friend had to move out for months.
✊🏾
Fear of acknowledging the situation which would then require confronting the situation.
Wow
Bingo.
Yep. I will never forget that comment.
Other people were pulling on their clothes, grabbing their kids and getting out of there.
I looked at him like he was nuts and continued banging on doors.
I think it’s a psychological avoidance technique.
Illusory comfort vs. confronting the reality of danger.
The fact that someone is screaming “FIRE!”  in the middle of the night should alarm you, move you to action even if you’d rather turn over and sleep some more.
You only get big fires because small ones go unchecked.
And we’ve been smelling smoke for a good long while around here.
“Is it a big fire” is a metaphor for so much right now
how the media, mainstream institutions and a huge swath of the white public viewed the rise of Trumpism, how millions of people saw (and see) the COVID pandemic.
Even how some see the threats to the coming election.
That response stunned me at the time but it was an education. 
Some people, for reasons of denial, complacency or plain cowardice, see a potential disaster & convince themselves that the problem won’t get bigger than it already is.
Even if they know small fires beget big ones.
Years ago I was staying with a friend in Brooklyn and reading late at night when I smelled smoke.
The apartment next door was completely engulfed in flames.
I woke my friend up then ran down the hall screaming FIRE!!!
One person poked his head out & asked “Well is it a big fire?”
This is so suicidally ridiculous that you can almost overlook the fact that the White House is being used as a prop in a partisan reelection campaign.
Agreed.
But it’s also not the kind of move you make to win votes in this election.
More as a hedge so that when the GOP is castigated as a reactionary party you can point to examples of prominent Republicans who broke with Trumpism.
A not-all-conservatives move.
It was all good until they started passing out Nikes. 
Some of my favorite classic fights, in no order: 
Douglass vs Covey
Davis vs Reagan 
King vs Connor
Little vs Jail Cell
Wells vs All Comers
No.
I still don’t get the fly.
I saw it like everyone else but am still asking “What was the director trying to tell us?”
This does a pretty thorough job imo.
Sooooo bizarre!
Someone in media needs to make a cover of Biggie’s “10 Crack Commandments” explaining to prospective sources how to leak confidential information safely. 
#7, you using that WhatsApp 
you could get slapped
Mad people getting busted
thinking apps can be trusted
He’s somewhere in the People Of Color racial palette but it’s hard to finger exactly what ethnic face he’s in.
Really? Because I was thinking that color was more Sherman Williams.
Gooood point!
We should crowdsource a satirical song “Donald and The Blacks” to the tune of “Benny and the Jets.”
That’s a triple down at the very least.
Half a shade from a minstrel show.
Despite everything in his presidency that preceded it, I was still shocked the day he broke into a minstrel routine. 
*on* my desk.
I’ll take it!
Nope.
I have a stack of them in my desk for the team working on the voter suppression documentary.
Is this out now? I’ve only seen the summary that leaked a few weeks back.
Dan Kaufman’s The Fall of Wisconsin: “Representative government is a failure.”
Already on the air.
Thanks!
I did a search for a GSH bio but overlooked this one.
Seriously? I’m sitting here listening to Winter in America and thinking how apropos it still is.
Let’s start a petition to get Mark Anthony Neal to write it. 
I would love to read a smart biography of Gil Scott-Heron.
Um... it’s twitter. I didn’t have room for her full name.
The publicly known people who were at the Rose Garden reception have had to disclose and that tally is up to 13 people. 
But how many regular people who were just friends or associates of ACB or support workers left that day with microbial door prize courtesy of the White House?
