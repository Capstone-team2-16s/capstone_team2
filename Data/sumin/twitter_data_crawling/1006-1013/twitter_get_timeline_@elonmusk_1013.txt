Yeah
At least success is in the set of all possible outcomes this time!
Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but he’s in a tough position with so many constituencies to please.
No way to make everyone happy.
Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this.
Starship is designed to carry people & cargo around Earth (also to moon & Mars).
Vast majority of use will be civilian.
It’s just like an airline in space.
All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian.
With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn’t clear until we hit the ceiling.
This time, it’s right.
Thank you, much more accurate haha
Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate.
Almost every element of production is >75% automated.
Only wire harnesses & general assembly, which are <10% of production costs, are primarily manual.
Will release order configurator probably in Jan
Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. 
The SoC’s sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it’s fairly obvious when one is discordant
Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes
they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.
Accurate analysis.
Quite a few ego/intelligence>>1 people in your comment thread haha.
Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements.
!
Glad Jen is safe!
Wow
Uh ok, here we go …
I don’t think this is accurate
Yeah, there are literally >1000% more cameras than 10 years ago, but still zero clear photos
Even if half that amount, it’s still a big deal!
🤣🤣
Definitely
Exactly.
He plays the “poor inventor” card, but was rich all along & invented nothing (as far as I know).
I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house & had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.
There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd… https://t.co/PPSorKWdI8
When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me & the board, no one left with him.
That says it all.
Interesting
Probably
I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica!
Yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries).
Herd immunity for vast majority of people & quarantine vulnerable was right though imo.
Sweden was right
There are sensitive elements, but they’re on the inside.
Also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what I’ve posted.
And yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what I’ve posted doesn’t need to reverse engineer!
Great work by SpaceX valve engineering & production!
Our tiles are mechanically attached
It might be used in some areas.
ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.
Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too.
A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.
Compilers need to improve imo.
Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user.
I’m proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha
Norway leads the world
Passed cryo proof
👍
Yeah, it’s not a contest.
Advanced casting crushes best-case 3D printing, but casting doesn’t work well for complex enclosed volumes & high strength or high temp alloys.
Great pics!
Maybe this should be the flag of Mars
Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.
It’s already sensible for rocket engine parts.
To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.
Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note
Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release.
Won’t need to wait for FSD.
It should be
Exactly.
We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh).
Gives a false sense of victory being close — a tantalizing local maximum — but reality is just too messy & weird.
Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once.
Yes, we will play sexy snake jazz 🤣
Yes
Yeah, provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler
Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution.
The Tesla approach is a general solution.
The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives.
Will release limited beta in a few weeks.
Yeah, we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5%
Great render.
Note, there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand & ship to booster.
Mimecraft
Yes
Autopilot team is making great progress.
Reality sure is complicated!
Aspiring to have no flame diverter in Boca, but this could turn out to be a mistake
We do have giant steel balls haha
We just completed a financing round, but will let you know when there is another one
I definitely need to try these tasty cakes & pastries on my next visit!
@MarcusHouseGame @brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Mass ratio. Liquid oxygen is much denser than liquid m… https://t.co/GNhcI8rEh3
Had the most amazing kebab ever just outside of Tacheles.
Too bad that place got torn down.
It was awesome.
You’re most welcome!
High bay should be finished (except for the giant gantry crane) within a few weeks.
Super Heavy stacking should begin around then.
That looks tasty!
The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
Sandy Munro understands engineering
That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica.
Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part.
Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one.
Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product
Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper & lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity & improved polar moment or inertia.
This is a *major* breakthrough.
But now we understand production much better.
It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009.
Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla.
No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years.
Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration.
You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun & takes ~100 people.
Production takes >10,000 people & hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg.
Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard.
Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve.
I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.
We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack & front & rear single piece castings.
Also, a new paint system.
Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk.
Fremont & Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven.
They are
I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart
7 bar absolute, which is fine for flight.
This was a proof test, rather than a burst test.
We’ll hopefully fix the leak today & retest.
Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking
One of the best shots ever!
Much sooner
Great photo!
It will soon
Once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US & hopefully southern Canada.
Other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval.
We’re not seeing notable differences yet.
I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights.
Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced.
Maybe turbopump hot sections.
Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that’s needed to meet max launch demand.
Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster & 3rd flight for active half of fairing.
Aiming for 10+ flights of booster & fairing by end of next year.
4th flight &amp; landing for this booster
5 minutes from launch.
Looks good so far.
So crazy to subsidize pollution!
This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car’s exhaust pipe.
It’s a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026.
Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale.
Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.
Turn volume to 11 &amp; play Powerglide in your Tesla 
FSD will solve these issues
Music volume on a Tesla goes to 11, because it’s louder than 10
One of my favorite writers.
Foundation is tough to make into a movie, but has outstanding potential.
💯
Rewatched Young Frankenstein this weekend.
Still awesome. Ovaltine?
The remake has the potential to be great.
I kinda liked the original tbh, but it’s possible to take it up a level.
Hollywood should just start with the sequel &amp; skip the original, because financials
This article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of 5 or more presently &amp; 10X long-term
Pretty wild, considering that Exxon was the most valuable company in the word when we went public 10 years ago
