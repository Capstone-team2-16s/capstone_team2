Yes sir...
I think everybody was caught off by the date.
From Adam to Michele both was saying mid to late January possible February...
Can’t play 50 games .. Thats a hard no for the players!
Has to be a min of 72.. the real question is what change in a week?
The league kept saying January January..
Everybody knew how big Christmas was and Olympics being late July months ago..
TV just mentioned it now??
Arrest this officer now!!!
Biggest trade deadline acquisition!!! 🏆🏆🏆 
Happy birthday to my boy @DevinBook !!!!!
That bubble bump was just the beginning!!!
This year he puts the league on notice!!!!
Enjoy your day brotha!!

Players have no problem playing at all.
We know the finances better then most, thats why we agreed to the bubble.
We know it’s a money thing.
But rest for the top players on top teams are key in staying healthy all season.
We trust Adam Silver and the direction he decides
The show will go on, just don’t cry a river when stars sit out TV games... esp Top teams that played a longer full season ...
I would be asking what was his number before getting the corona virus??

@SiP03 is a pro!
Could easily be in the NBA...
Keep working brotha!
It’s mind boggling that organizations don’t realize how key locker room/vets are.. @jj_redick touches on it.
You first need Talent, health, and chemistry.
The key to Chemistry is the vets.
It’s a Long season and you will go through ups and downs.
Vets and Culture are the 🔑
Wow!!!!!
