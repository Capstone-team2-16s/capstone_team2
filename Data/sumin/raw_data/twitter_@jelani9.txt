Someone could make a great short film called “Early Vote” and just pull together scenes like this one and the people dancing online in Philly.
Fucking exhausted.
Yes
I def have that division.
Also shirts that are strictly for working out.
Wowww
👍🏾
Ah. I was thinking 12 but we’re in the same ballpark.
How many t-shirts should a middle aged man own?
Just became aware of @jennimonet’s Indigenously newsletter.
Such great coverage of Native American affairs.
Check it out here:
Wow.
I sometimes pass Grant’s Tomb when I go for walks around Harlem.
And when I do I always stop and take a moment to reflect on that.
We only need to look 3 years after Lincoln’s death to dismiss 45’s ridiculous “More for black people than anyone except maybe Lincoln” claim. 
Ulysses S. Grant opposed white terrorism and crushed the KKK.
And Orange is out here talking about “stand back and stand by.”
We spent a year tracing the elements of voter suppression in Wisconsin and their implications nationally and for the upcoming election.

That one waitress at the Waffle House out in East Point.
Lol
Anyone who rented an apartment to a black family between 1974-1980.

Ok, I’ll start: People who did more for black America than Donald Trump.

#poorboys
No, the problem is blackface.
Someone should follow up and ask “So what do you think Lincoln did for black people that you didn’t.”
In fairness the pandemic will also end “soon” so we won’t need the healthcare plan. 
That sound you hear is the gasp of shock as people learn that a former prosecutor is more liberal than an actual Democratic Socialist.
Malarkey!
Early rounds but if this were a boxing match I’d say the challenger is hitting the champ whenever he wants to and mixing up his punches.
“Americans don’t panic. He panics.”
Yeesh. #biden
Somebody backstage had Biden listening to “Ether” before he came out. @KeeangaYamahtta
Biden continues looking at the camera and talking to the audience — one of the best tactics from the first debate.
Trump focused on Biden, Biden focused on America. #thedebate
“His Democrat governors — they’re shut down so tight and they’re dying.”
We’ve now reached the Less American Parts of America part of tonight’s program.
“You are xenophobic but not because you closed down travel from China.” — Biden.
“People are learning to die with it. Learning to live with it? C’mon. We’re dying with it.”
Biden on Trump’s claim that we’re learning to live with the pandemic.
Long ago thought the whole “Biden is senile” line was a dumb strategy because eventually the incumbent was going to have to do exactly this: debate with someone who has a stronger command of facts on specific issues.
Yes. More than the number who fought for the colonies.
Pertinent question.
Also, who are the Trump voters who don’t vote at all in Harrison-Graham.
So wait, John Brown is wrong and George Washington is not?

This is about right.
I met Tom Steyer once, in Alabama.
We were on the line for grits at a hotel buffet. 
Was great working with you. So proud of this collaboration.
Thank you to everyone who watched Whose Vote Counts on PBS.
We spent a year working on this film, navigating a pandemic to continue filming because we thought it was a crucial story to tell.
If you missed it you can watch on http://pbs.org and YouTube.
None.
😂
🤷🏾‍♂️
Picked up my phone and saw that I got 65 text messages this afternoon. Odd.
Oh, just SO MUCH slime from the DeKalb County days.
There’s way, way too much to go into but anyone who knows Vernon Jones, or has lived in Atlanta for more than 5 minutes, would not be surprised he craven, grimy and stupid enough to crowd surf at a Trump rally.
Really proud of the work my colleagues at Columbia Journalism Investigations did on this examination of the likelihood an absentee ballot will be rejected.
People always talk about the sap who brings a knife to a gunfight but theyr’e not nearly as bad off as the mark who brings a bottle of wine because they thought it was a dinner party.
+1
Let’s make it official: *Excluding Megan Thee Stallion
I want the rappers to, y’know, stop.
So effing embarrassing that this is what the world now thinks of American education.
Were.
Remember that party in the Hamptons in 2017 where Kellyanne and Ivanka were chilling with Chuck Schumer and it seemed to establish that regardless of party the overclass has more in common with each other than their voters?
Diane Feinstein made them hold her beer.
The wild thing is that Eazy E went to a fundraiser at the George HW Bush White House in 1991 and got criticized about *for the rest of his life.
* Ice Cube apparently forgot about that when he decided to collaborate with an infinitely worse administration.
Or Ice Cube in the White House.
Played yourself.
Half-woke is worse than fully asleep. 🧊
I definitely thought about that too.
One step closer to being done with Individual 1.
If you’d asked me to name the best person to succeed Justice Ginsberg on the court this is the first name that would’ve come to mind. 👇🏽
But there’s a difference between an impersonal alarm and an actual human being banging on doors and yelling “fire!” in the middle of the night.
That’s a great reply.
I thought the same.
It was a real test of character to read this because of the competing impulses to be angry and judgmental
this thinking has killed tens of thousands of people, what’s wrong with you??? 
and to have empathy for someone who is suffering profoundly.
I could see that.
Really? Say more. I’m curious.
Wow.
Interestingly, this was 2002, not long after we did the Cruse book together.
The wall between the two apartments burned through and my friend had to move out for months.
✊🏾
Fear of acknowledging the situation which would then require confronting the situation.
Wow
Bingo.
Yep. I will never forget that comment.
Other people were pulling on their clothes, grabbing their kids and getting out of there.
I looked at him like he was nuts and continued banging on doors.
I think it’s a psychological avoidance technique.
Illusory comfort vs. confronting the reality of danger.
The fact that someone is screaming “FIRE!”  in the middle of the night should alarm you, move you to action even if you’d rather turn over and sleep some more.
You only get big fires because small ones go unchecked.
And we’ve been smelling smoke for a good long while around here.
“Is it a big fire” is a metaphor for so much right now
how the media, mainstream institutions and a huge swath of the white public viewed the rise of Trumpism, how millions of people saw (and see) the COVID pandemic.
Even how some see the threats to the coming election.
That response stunned me at the time but it was an education. 
Some people, for reasons of denial, complacency or plain cowardice, see a potential disaster & convince themselves that the problem won’t get bigger than it already is.
Even if they know small fires beget big ones.
Years ago I was staying with a friend in Brooklyn and reading late at night when I smelled smoke.
The apartment next door was completely engulfed in flames.
I woke my friend up then ran down the hall screaming FIRE!!!
One person poked his head out & asked “Well is it a big fire?”
This is so suicidally ridiculous that you can almost overlook the fact that the White House is being used as a prop in a partisan reelection campaign.
Agreed.
But it’s also not the kind of move you make to win votes in this election.
More as a hedge so that when the GOP is castigated as a reactionary party you can point to examples of prominent Republicans who broke with Trumpism.
A not-all-conservatives move.
It was all good until they started passing out Nikes. 
Some of my favorite classic fights, in no order: 
Douglass vs Covey
Davis vs Reagan 
King vs Connor
Little vs Jail Cell
Wells vs All Comers
No.
I still don’t get the fly.
I saw it like everyone else but am still asking “What was the director trying to tell us?”
This does a pretty thorough job imo.
Sooooo bizarre!
Someone in media needs to make a cover of Biggie’s “10 Crack Commandments” explaining to prospective sources how to leak confidential information safely. 
#7, you using that WhatsApp

He’s somewhere in the People Of Color racial palette but it’s hard to finger exactly what ethnic face he’s in.
Really? Because I was thinking that color was more Sherman Williams.
Gooood point!
We should crowdsource a satirical song “Donald and The Blacks” to the tune of “Benny and the Jets.”
That’s a triple down at the very least.
Half a shade from a minstrel show.
Despite everything in his presidency that preceded it, I was still shocked the day he broke into a minstrel routine. 
*on* my desk.
I’ll take it!
Nope.
I have a stack of them in my desk for the team working on the voter suppression documentary.
Is this out now? I’ve only seen the summary that leaked a few weeks back.
Dan Kaufman’s The Fall of Wisconsin: “Representative government is a failure.”
Already on the air.
Thanks!
I did a search for a GSH bio but overlooked this one.
Seriously? I’m sitting here listening to Winter in America and thinking how apropos it still is.
Let’s start a petition to get Mark Anthony Neal to write it. 
I would love to read a smart biography of Gil Scott-Heron.
Um... it’s twitter. I didn’t have room for her full name.
The publicly known people who were at the Rose Garden reception have had to disclose and that tally is up to 13 people. 
But how many regular people who were just friends or associates of ACB or support workers left that day with microbial door prize courtesy of the White House?
The abolitionist David Walker wrote a prayer that started “Oh Lord, please deliver us from the white Christians.”
They can’t help themselves.
Sending strength, peace and wishes for a full recovery to my @HowardU classmate @AnandaLewis
The only other option is that he has a case bad enough to require hospitalization but bounces back so quickly he can hit the trail again within 2 weeks.
Does anybody think that’s realistic?
That’s why the lies and misdirection surrounding the timing of his diagnosis are so frustrating.
We have no idea how quickly this is actually happening.
Yes.
So the campaign is effectively over and the last time the public saw this dude he was snarling, screaming and insulting his opponent’s son for having a drug problem. Nice parting image.
Stephen Miller fear-tweeting as he awaits his own test results.
Wowww
I can’t believe he just said this. No, for real.
I can’t believe *he* just said this.
Damn.
Asked why they refuse to mention Herman Cain’s death they fall back on the reflex answer “He should’ve stopped resisting the police.”
Even Ralph Ellison would be shocked by this shit tho.
Why is this still happening?
So a month before the most crucial election of our lives we have a COVID cluster working it way through the White House, an infected president and a challenger who spent 90 minutes in a room with multiple likely contagious people.
We’re living in an episode of “24.”
Uh yeah.
He literally said they haven’t had any problems come out of the rallies.
Like they’d already forgotten that Cain died.
True, true.
Think whatever you want but tweeting ill wishes or voicing a hope for his demise is likely the stupidest thing you can do right now.
There’s a case for releasing this early.
Like tonight.
Forget any hope of criticizing the undergrads for ANY violation of the protocols.
I believe it was fuck.
As in “who gives a fuck about Christmas.”
Did we not visit this question when Ronny Jackson held that office?
This is the problem with having a chronic, prolific liar in office.
He submitted a fake letter about his health during the 2016 election.
There’s zero reason to take his word for anything.
I’m not saying this is false but we certainly should not presume it to be true on the basis of a tweet from him.
It was already clear that the debates were a waste of time but now there’s no real justification for having more of them.
Chris Wallace should be tested immediately too even just to gauge the risk of people in that room on Tuesday.
2020 is James Brown throwing off the cape.
Keep Pelosi in an isolation chamber.
I woulda bought you a gift but, y’know...
Are we sure this is true?
I only saw one episode.
Gonna give it one more before deciding.
Where can I find the original?
Watched Utopia because I had insomnia.
Trying to decide what I think of Episode 1.
Right.
Wait, I didn’t know there was a UK version.
Is it streaming someplace?
Is anyone else watching Utopia?
No, actual oatmeal with pb and a dash of j.
Hola!
Congrats!
Right. Mine has been all over the map since March.
I’ve given up and decided that I’m just up virtuously early.
good luck with the recovery!
Yep.
Ha!
peanut butter &amp; jelly oatmeal with coconut milk.
if it doesn’t cure insomnia it at least makes me feel better about being awake.
There’s that.
That end-stage level of insomnia where even your friends on the West Coast are asleep already...
This.
*Losing
Or even, as Tom Friedman said, refuse to continue any further debates until he releases his taxes.
I think you’re right.
The Biden people are probably concerned about looking like they’ve backed out and he’s afraid of Trump but in reality they’ve won and have nothing left to prove.
For kinfolk, yes. But skinfolk don’t believe in all that.
I’ve often heard it said that to whom much is given, much is required. 
But not the other part: to whom nothing is given we expect even more.
The person who told Biden to keep looking at the camera and addressing the viewers deserves a raise. 
Every time he started a sentence with “Folks” it was like he was breaking the 4th wall on the world’s shittiest reality tv program.
The next #VERZUZ should be skinfolk vs. kinfolk.
Smiling and shuffling would be more dignified than this act.
Trump was using interruptions last night the way a loser boxer uses a clench — an attempt to stop the action that you don’t have an answer for and that is putting your opponent ahead on the scorecards.
I said the same.
One Country For Old Men
Future moderators need to have the capacity to cut off the mics.
But not really tho.
The thugs I knew really were about that life.
But this dude only talks a big game.
The phrase is “Keep my son’s name out your mouth.”
I saw that. Weak.
I’m referring to the interruptions.
Chris Wallace taking a lot of heat for his moderation but I’m not sure how he could reign in the red-faced one short of cutting his mic.
If you give me $5 million I’ll tell you.
(Wait, I just did.)
You ain’t know?
Whoever told him to keep looking at the camera and saying “This guy is lying to you” is smart.
Otherwise it would lapse into just two old guys yelling on tv.
Would it be worth it?
Just once I want someone to look at Trump after he’s insulted their family member and say “Mention my son/daughter/wife/father again and we’ll finish this debate in the parking lot.”
Pretty sure Ben Gay is going to surge in the polls tomorrow.
I’m thrilled to have been able to participate on the jury.
A well-deserved and timely recognition for work whose import has only become more apparent.
The odd thing about this whole “Park Avenue vs Scranton” thing is that the incumbent is going to get blown out on Park Avenue, uptown and downtown.
If anything, he’s likely to be more competitive in Scranton.
From a standpoint of scandal it almost would’ve been better for him to have paid zero than to pay $750.
The pittance is an insult in its own right.
As @JoyAnnReid pointed out, the number is memorable.
Everyone knows just how much money that is, or rather isn’t.
Not that there wasn’t already cause for concern but a narcissistic fear of humiliation is now even more closely paired with legal liability as reasons trump could do absolutely anything, including use of force, in the coming election.
Our situation has grown even more dangerous.
Other scenario that occurred to me: after 4 years antagonizing and persecuting civil service employees his future will be in the hands of them should he lose this election.
It’ll also be interesting to see what a Biden DOJ or IRS would do with this situation.
Secondary implications for this story are the Trump offspring.
They may not care that the likelihood of him leaving office in ignominy is higher.
But the likelihood of him going broke immediately afterward tho...
Michael Cohen wearing Trump out on MSNBC.
"In the year he paid $750 in taxes I paid more than $3 million.
If I went to jail for 3 years for tax evasion he should get 300 years."
That sound you just heard was Bernie Sanders benchpressing 450 lbs just to, y’know, vent.
To be a fly on Tish James’s wall right now...
This part.
It’s odd that some people think this is debatable.
National sovereignty is a fairly low prerequisite for superpower status.
Can you really say that about a country whose elections are besieged by foreign intervention and whose leadership does nothing about it?
yes, because men who have daughters are never sexist.
The United States is not a super power.
Damn, this really got to me.
This person not only helped a cancer survivor regain her strength, he performed a service to American Democracy, such as that term applies.
Damn. 
For some unknown reason polls show Georgia now leaning toward Biden...
Wow.
As evidenced by the fact that you couldn’t even find a black PR person to tell you not to say this dumb sh*t.
I think by “his community” they mean white people.
This isn’t even surreal anymore.
Its just stupid.
