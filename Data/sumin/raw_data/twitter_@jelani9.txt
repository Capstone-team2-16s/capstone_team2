That said, this Under Armor joint is 🔥🔥🔥
👍🏼
You know you’ve been in a pandemic too long when you’re excited about breaking out your new mask.
So I’m thinking of getting an e-bike. 
But I know nada about e-bikes. 
Basically looking for something I can use to substitute for the subway in Manhattan commutes.
Any suggestions?
Worked out great for Gerald Ford. s'
The 1,000,000 x .001 MAGA March
Trump is so out of sorts he’s even ripping off ideas from Louis Farrakhan... who actually did have a million people at his march.
Some day we’ll have to do something about these coloreds daring to not only have opinions but say them out loud.
Good lord, if I didn’t hear my mother swearing she would leave my father the second Telly Savalas showed up on the doorstep...
I suspect I was not the only kid hearing that.
Many thanks.
Congrats on the book! Out this week!
I misnumbered!
She’s dominating this tournament.
We had Atticus Finch in there against Abraham Lincoln and they fought a tough match to a draw.
Nope!
But she’s the only person with a shot at stopping Sandra Bullock’s march to the title.
So true!
Mississippi Burning should’ve gotten further in the tourney (tho it did lose to another oldie.)
Came in heavily favored but got crushed by Sandra Bullock’s Blind Side in Round 1.
Tough loss.
Ok, last one (for today) White Savior Elimination Tournament: Round 7: Two giants who easily dispatched their opponents in the first round go head to head to get to the White Savior semi finals.
*The goal is to find THE most redemptive white person ever, real or imagined.
He’s in round 5.
White Savior Elimination Tournament, Round 5: (Civil Rights Edition.)
*The goal is to find THE most redemptive white person ever to exist, real or imagined.
Sam Worthington is proving really strong early on here.
There’s some question about if he can weather the sheer orientalist assault of Last Samurai but remember Sam not only saved the natives but seduced the indigenous girl + got her ex man killed.
Tough competition!
Oh you KNOW I have Gene on my list.
Completely overlooking FBI harassment of MLK?
Single handedly un-lynching a black man in Mississippi?
So. Damn. Pure.
Here you have it folks, a DRAW between Honest Abe and Atticus Finch.
They’ll both proceed in the tournament to face other competition.
That movie is still in theaters.
White Savior Elimination Tournament, Round 4:
*The goal is to find THE most redemptive white person ever, real or imagined.
White Savior Elimation Tournament, Round 3: (The Heavy Hitters)
*The goal is to find THE most redemptive white person ever, real or imagined.
Don’t worry, Imaginary Lincoln is in the next round — against Atticus Finch.
Colored Commentary: Here we see a really strong showing from Dangerous Minds, really just dominating Great Wall from the beginning, showing why it has been a favorite to win it all.
Stevens deserves his own film.
Yeah but we need to put him up against a real heavy hitter.
Like maybe only Lincoln is real competition.
Hell yes.
He makes the list.
Ouch. That hurt... but nah. It’s not too soon!
White Savior Elimination Tournament Round 2: 
*The goal is to find THE most redemptive white person to ever exist, real or imagined.
We should also include that Mel Gibson joint The Patriot, where he plays a SC plantation owner who not only fights the British for freedom, but legit *pays* his slaves.
So. Damn. Good.
White Savior Elimination Tournament: Round 1.
*The goal is to find THE most redemptive white person ever, real or imagined.
Yes.
Yes
No, that’s a whole other elimination tournament in itself.
vs Kevin Costner... as Kevin Costner.
Someone should catalogue everything single white savior figure in American cinema and then make and elimination bracket.
Round one could be Spielberg’s Lincoln vs that lady from Dangerous Minds.
Wow.
I teach in a journalism school and would never ever encourage a student to do this.
Yep. I learned this in school!
Wouldn’t be a bargain if it wasn’t!
It’s Hardwood Wednesday so 15% off. 
What? It was an honest mistake!
You know it.
How’d you know?
No, journalism.
Why would it be about refurbishment?
I went to high school about a block off utopia.
👍🏾
Shares the same parking lot as a matter of fact.
Great options right next door.
So you know the place? Good.
See you Wednesday.
Next door — how’d you know?
We’re in luck.
John “The King of Hardwoods” Billingsley is going to do an in-class presentation.
I have to issue a correction: Wednesday’s class will *not* meet at Columbia University. 
We will meet at the Columbia Flooring and Drywall Outlet on Utopia Parkway in Queens.
Apologies for any confusion this may have caused.
Brilliant.
For him.
Correction: we will be meeting at that landscaping place next to the porn joint, across from the crematorium.
You know the area — the one where nobody actually goes if their GPS is working properly. 
See you Wednesday.
Students in my class: please note that in light of the election we will be meeting *in person* this week.
Class will be held in the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia.
Would not at all be surprised if he walks off the job.
Just issues a bunch of pardons then splits in  the middle of the night and hides out in Florida until Biden is inaugurated.
It’s not the first time a plot line from Veep showed up in this administration
Joe is AMPED.
Ran all the way to the podium and speaking like a preacher trying to pay off the sanctuary.
“The African American community always had my back and I’ll have yours.” 
That line is going to be repeated regularly for the next four years.
Noted that Kamala Harris didn’t even feign civility with the standard “I’d like to thank our opponents for a hard fought and spirited campaign.”
Was basically like “I won’t even insult y’all like that.”
I’ve thought about this some.
2008 was joy. 2020 was relief. 
Dead wrong. 😂
Spelman College to Howard University be like
#howardu #spelman
Frederick Douglass Circle, Harlem USA. 
YOU KNOW!!!
Two words for yall: Howard. University.
Democracy.
Thinking of John Lewis, John McCain, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the many others who did not live long enough to see this man defeated but whose memory helped make it happen.
YES!!!!
Yep.
At some point the refusal to call it based on projections starts looking like deference to 45.
Definitely didn’t see this one coming. 
Bahahahaha
Wondering if no Republican state wants to be the one to put Biden over the top and thereby incur Orange’s wrath.
He bragged that he told people to stop the testing during a pandemic.
Can’t really be a shock that he tried to stop the counting during an election.
Do we need to run down the list of democratically elected leaders that the US toppled, destabilized president killed?
There’s a prospect of a defeated Trump being even *more* antagonistic toward the pandemic crisis measures.
This as we’re heading into the worst months.
The inauguration will take place amid the darkest stretch of the crisis.
Statler & Waldorf.
Those are the names of the two elderly hecklers in the balcony on the Muppet Show. 
Also, the model for what Donald Trump’s role in public life will look like for the next four years.
Really need to stop reflexively referring to the President as “the leader of the free world.”
We don’t know how these “non-white” voters you’re juxtaposing against “progressive intellectuals” drew their conclusions.
But it would be smart to start by asking if Biden’s 1994 crime bill and Trump’s First Step Act muddied the waters Re who is the racist in the race.
It was always a dumb supposition because it assumed that a person couldn’t vote for Trump while opposed to his racism because they *really really* disliked Hillary Clinton, the historically unpopular democratic nominee.
Moreover, the point that connects this to the silly fixation with Obama/Trump voters was the reflexive attempt to diminish the role racism plays in Trump’s support — something that social science has pointed to consistently.
The holes in the argument are apparent but if you’d like I’ll point them out.
1. When you say “non-white” voters you’re talking about a category so broad as to be useless.
But let’s presume you mean blacks and Hispanics.
You’re also assuming they only vote on racism.
But that’s not what sparked the interest in that population in 2016 and you know it.
This is the 2020 version of “what about the people who voted for Obama and then switched to Trump?” 
The 15th Amendment, which gave black men the vote, was ratified 150 years ago.
It was hoped that black voters would offset the political power of racist whites who’d nearly destroyed the country.
A century and a half later it’s doing the same thing.
To be black in the first week of November 2020 is to feel that you’ve been called off the bench, yet again, and told the whole game is on your shoulders.
I mean... technically someone called it two days ago it’s just that nobody believes him.
Yep.
That’s why I remember it.
Election reminds me of what Sugar Ray Leonard said after his first fight with Roberto Duran: “I threw my best, he threw his best.”
Reporter: What landed? 
Leonard: Everything.
True. Perot.
If there’s any question about how demoralizing this situation is, even if Biden wins, the last one-term POTUS was Bush in 92. 
He was done in by a tax hike and a recession.
45 has a recession, a pandemic, racism, corruption & a decade without paying taxes. And it’s *this* close.
Yeah. On Howard’s campus no less.
No but I just bought those same dumbbells.
Been there.
Actually about to go back there today.
Curious about what kinds of home workout spaces people — especially New Yorkers — have created since the pandemic as I sit here trying to gerrymander a fitness area into my NYC apartment.
No but you can start one and call yourselves The Endnotes.
Would be too poetic if the late John Lewis’s former district was what sent 45 packing. 
#ATL 
#GoodTrouble 
#thebesttrouble
Exactly.
No.
He was just in over his head.
No.
But he understood the rules of one game and naively thought that meant he could win at a whole other game.
This year is the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment & the 150th of the 15th Amendment.
Right now the hopes for American democracy hinge upon black women — a population that needed *both* those amendments (and a Voting Rights Act) to get the right to vote in the first place.
Same night???
ATL come through.
Seeing the way Cube, Wayne  and 50 played themselves reminds me of Stringer Bell trying to be a real estate mogul.
If Georgia puts Biden-Harris over the top the administration and everyone who voted for it will be indebted to Stacey Abrams for an idea she had a decade ago. 
Here’s my profile of her from last year.
Taking suggestions for the Fulton County vote soundtrack.
Fulton County votes about to show up like 
It’s in the next tweet. 😥
Again.
The future of American democracy depends right now on what black people in the hoods across the country did yesterday.
That thing about this election being dangerous and there being a threat of violence? 
We’re about to enter that part.
We can debate about a lot of abrupt changes in the GOP on trade, deficits, immigration, etc but the most stunning has been their complete reversal on national defense and sovereignty. 
At least the Cold Warriors knew when the country was being undermined.
Absolutely stunning to me that a person with this record of abject failure and a quarter of a million dead Americans strewn in the background could not only retain support but benefit from a surge in voting.
No matter how this turns out we are in deep trouble collectively.
😂
That was one of the strongest arguments made in Biden’s behalf tbh.
Science is increasingly worried that the virus will become endemic, a persistent threat to our lives.
We should have the same concerns about the chaotic forces of Trumpism, even if — maybe especially if — their principal suffers a crushing defeat tonight.
Endgame.
Black = radical
Hahahaha.
Now it’s time to have that conversation every parent dreads: “Son, there’s something called the electoral college...”
Ray Charles, James Brown — Georgia.
Heading into the final round with no idea what’s really on the scorecards.
How you feeling?
Ok, it’s 3pm on the east coast.
Plus it’s daylight savings time so *really* 4pm.
And this anxiety has made every day at least an hour longer so we can round up to 5pm.
Whatcha drinking?
Cool.
We’ll spot you 157 years.
Let’s talk about the fugitive slave and slave trade clauses of the Constitution, the gag rule, the Trail of Tears, secession, the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Slaughterhouse Cases, Tulsa in 1921...
Do you know any of this? There’s more.
One day before the election we’re reminded that Joe Biden, like Barack Obama before him, is closing out a presidential campaign with the promise to fix the national catastrophe presided over by the Republican currently in office.
Woke from at 3 am from a dream that I found bags full of undelivered absentee ballots and was trying to get them to the right place.
I’m gonna go out on a limb and say I’m a small bit anxious.
I am too. But I’m not shocked that I need to worry about her.
She’s black and female and may be a heartbeat away from the presidency.
But an old centrist white dude? Unsafe from angry white people?
Didn’t see that coming.
Impolitic to say this but we spent 8 years quietly fearful for Obama’s life simply because he was a black man in the White House. 
2020 has delivered a ton of twists but never did I imagine I would legit fear for Joe Biden’s safety too. Especially if he wins.
Was more thinking of immigrant populations in the county who haven’t sworn allegiance to either party or like things about both.
Stoddard, that is.
The GOP’s attempt to toss 127,000 votes from Harris County, TX is not at all unrelated to the fact that it’s one of the two most ethnically diverse counties in the United States.
The other, not at all coincidentally, is Queens.  Where 45 is from.
Hahahahaha.
This is *exactly* what I thought of as well.
The attempt to throw out 127,000 votes out of Harris County, TX is, like everything else we’ve seen from the GOP since 2016, not only corrupt but short-sighted.
Who is ever voting GOP there after the party tosses their lawfully cast ballots?
Blocked literally just for posting an excerpt of his work with no comment.
That speaks for itself.
Wow
Debating whether this is extraordinarily dumb or typically dishonest: you well know that one of the biggest criticisms the Sanders campaign encountered was the fact that the candidate *was not* a Democrat
There should be a single number you can text the words VOTED ALREADY and have it sent to all 328 organizations sending you reminders.
The polite version of a truth I heard all through my growing-up years: you got to bring some to get some. 
What that means is that the attempts to intimidate voters assumes these people scare easy.
They don’t.
These people would’ve protested during WWII because rationing butter violates their rights.
Strange how many of the people who completely lost it over closures and mask mandates have not a word to say about civil forfeiture.
This.
White House focus group was like “I’m told the Coloreds are really fond of platinum so we should totally call it that.”
exactly.
The entertainers backing the so-called “Platinum Plan” fall into the sweet spot of low information/high profile — people who don’t know that the plan is this year’s immigrant caravan: a fiction created to mislead voters and which you’ll never hear of again after the election.
Today is hug-your-editor day.
Damn.
Yes? 🤣
Workout playlist. Yep.
Also in the middle of a respiratory pandemic you might not want to roll out an endorsement from a dude named Weezy.
Throwback to 2016 that might explain that Weezy/Cube/Kanye Trump collabo.
It’s called “Donald Trump is a Rapper.”
That fave hip hop playlist getting shorter by the minute.
I hate to self-quote but [then proceeds to self-quote] I saw this coming in 2016! 
Donald Trump is obsessed with wealth, treats women like accessories and owned a fashion line.
Rappers swooning over him is the *least* surprising part of 2020. 
First the Fat Boys break up, now this... 
I had the exact same reaction.
Important words. Please retweet this message. 
On the other hand it makes sense: the Constitution gives an explicit right to bear arms and no explicit right to vote.
Historians are wondering that sh*t right now.
Wonderful place. I lost a few afternoons wandering in here.
Friend of mine bought a gun today.
Like many people he’s concerned about the climate surrounding the election.
He made his selection, bought the piece and left.
Then realized it takes *hours* less time to buy a gun in Georgia than it does to vote there.
Today is the start of my 4-week course with @torchlabs on creating positive change around race in the workplace.

Also, it’s possible, depending on where you live, that your ballot has already been counted and the system simply hasn’t updates to reflect that fact.
No.
We did a documentary about this.
Check to see if late ballots in your state will be counted if they’re postmarked before the election.
But don’t vote in person because you could be accused of voter fraud if both are counted.
I used a site specific to NYC voters: https://t.co/K8fysfcsQ2
That feeling that is typically reserved for that notification that a check just deposited in my account.
Someone could make a great short film called “Early Vote” and just pull together scenes like this one and the people dancing online in Philly.
Fucking exhausted.
Yes
I def have that division.
Also shirts that are strictly for working out.
Wowww
👍🏾
Ah. I was thinking 12 but we’re in the same ballpark.
How many t-shirts should a middle aged man own?
Just became aware of @jennimonet’s Indigenously newsletter.
Such great coverage of Native American affairs.

Wow.
I sometimes pass Grant’s Tomb when I go for walks around Harlem.
And when I do I always stop and take a moment to reflect on that.
We only need to look 3 years after Lincoln’s death to dismiss 45’s ridiculous “More for black people than anyone except maybe Lincoln” claim. 
Ulysses S. Grant opposed white terrorism and crushed the KKK.
And Orange is out here talking about “stand back and stand by.”
We spent a year tracing the elements of voter suppression in Wisconsin and their implications nationally and for the upcoming election.

#poorboys
No, the problem is blackface.
Someone should follow up and ask “So what do you think Lincoln did for black people that you didn’t.”
In fairness the pandemic will also end “soon” so we won’t need the healthcare plan. 
That sound you hear is the gasp of shock as people learn that a former prosecutor is more liberal than an actual Democratic Socialist.
Malarkey!
Early rounds but if this were a boxing match I’d say the challenger is hitting the champ whenever he wants to and mixing up his punches.
“Americans don’t panic. He panics.”
Yeesh. #biden
Somebody backstage had Biden listening to “Ether” before he came out. @KeeangaYamahtta
Biden continues looking at the camera and talking to the audience — one of the best tactics from the first debate.
Trump focused on Biden, Biden focused on America. #thedebate
“His Democrat governors — they’re shut down so tight and they’re dying.”
We’ve now reached the Less American Parts of America part of tonight’s program.
“You are xenophobic but not because you closed down travel from China.” — Biden.
“People are learning to die with it. Learning to live with it? C’mon. We’re dying with it.”
Biden on Trump’s claim that we’re learning to live with the pandemic.
Long ago thought the whole “Biden is senile” line was a dumb strategy because eventually the incumbent was going to have to do exactly this: debate with someone who has a stronger command of facts on specific issues.
Yes. More than the number who fought for the colonies.
Pertinent question.
Also, who are the Trump voters who don’t vote at all in Harrison-Graham.
So wait, John Brown is wrong and George Washington is not?

This is about right.
I met Tom Steyer once, in Alabama.
We were on the line for grits at a hotel buffet. 
Was great working with you. So proud of this collaboration.
Thank you to everyone who watched Whose Vote Counts on PBS.
We spent a year working on this film, navigating a pandemic to continue filming because we thought it was a crucial story to tell.
If you missed it you can watch on http://pbs.org and YouTube.
None.

Picked up my phone and saw that I got 65 text messages this afternoon. Odd.
Oh, just SO MUCH slime from the DeKalb County days.
There’s way, way too much to go into but anyone who knows Vernon Jones, or has lived in Atlanta for more than 5 minutes, would not be surprised he craven, grimy and stupid enough to crowd surf at a Trump rally.
Really proud of the work my colleagues at Columbia Journalism Investigations did on this examination of the likelihood an absentee ballot will be rejected.
People always talk about the sap who brings a knife to a gunfight but theyr’e not nearly as bad off as the mark who brings a bottle of wine because they thought it was a dinner party.

Let’s make it official: *Excluding Megan Thee Stallion
I want the rappers to, y’know, stop.
So effing embarrassing that this is what the world now thinks of American education.
Were.
Remember that party in the Hamptons in 2017 where Kellyanne and Ivanka were chilling with Chuck Schumer and it seemed to establish that regardless of party the overclass has more in common with each other than their voters?
Diane Feinstein made them hold her beer.
The wild thing is that Eazy E went to a fundraiser at the George HW Bush White House in 1991 and got criticized about *for the rest of his life.
* Ice Cube apparently forgot about that when he decided to collaborate with an infinitely worse administration.
Or Ice Cube in the White House.
Played yourself.
Half-woke is worse than fully asleep. 🧊
I definitely thought about that too.
One step closer to being done with Individual 1.
If you’d asked me to name the best person to succeed Justice Ginsberg on the court this is the first name that would’ve come to mind. 👇🏽
But there’s a difference between an impersonal alarm and an actual human being banging on doors and yelling “fire!” in the middle of the night.
That’s a great reply.
I thought the same.
It was a real test of character to read this because of the competing impulses to be angry and judgmental
this thinking has killed tens of thousands of people, what’s wrong with you??? 
and to have empathy for someone who is suffering profoundly.
I could see that.
Really? Say more. I’m curious.
Wow.
Interestingly, this was 2002, not long after we did the Cruse book together.
The wall between the two apartments burned through and my friend had to move out for months.
✊🏾
Fear of acknowledging the situation which would then require confronting the situation.
Wow
Bingo.
Yep. I will never forget that comment.
Other people were pulling on their clothes, grabbing their kids and getting out of there.
I looked at him like he was nuts and continued banging on doors.
I think it’s a psychological avoidance technique.
Illusory comfort vs. confronting the reality of danger.
The fact that someone is screaming “FIRE!”  in the middle of the night should alarm you, move you to action even if you’d rather turn over and sleep some more.
You only get big fires because small ones go unchecked.
And we’ve been smelling smoke for a good long while around here.
“Is it a big fire” is a metaphor for so much right now
how the media, mainstream institutions and a huge swath of the white public viewed the rise of Trumpism, how millions of people saw (and see) the COVID pandemic.
Even how some see the threats to the coming election.
That response stunned me at the time but it was an education. 
Some people, for reasons of denial, complacency or plain cowardice, see a potential disaster & convince themselves that the problem won’t get bigger than it already is.
Even if they know small fires beget big ones.
Years ago I was staying with a friend in Brooklyn and reading late at night when I smelled smoke.
The apartment next door was completely engulfed in flames.
I woke my friend up then ran down the hall screaming FIRE!!!
One person poked his head out & asked “Well is it a big fire?”
This is so suicidally ridiculous that you can almost overlook the fact that the White House is being used as a prop in a partisan reelection campaign.
Agreed.
But it’s also not the kind of move you make to win votes in this election.
More as a hedge so that when the GOP is castigated as a reactionary party you can point to examples of prominent Republicans who broke with Trumpism.
A not-all-conservatives move.
It was all good until they started passing out Nikes.

He’s somewhere in the People Of Color racial palette but it’s hard to finger exactly what ethnic face he’s in.

Gooood point!
We should crowdsource a satirical song “Donald and The Blacks” to the tune of “Benny and the Jets.”
That’s a triple down at the very least.
Half a shade from a minstrel show.

I did a search for a GSH bio but overlooked this one.
Seriously? I’m sitting here listening to Winter in America and thinking how apropos it still is.
Let’s start a petition to get Mark Anthony Neal to write it. 
I would love to read a smart biography of Gil Scott-Heron.
Um... it’s twitter. I didn’t have room for her full name.
The publicly known people who were at the Rose Garden reception have had to disclose and that tally is up to 13 people. 
But how many regular people who were just friends or associates of ACB or support workers left that day with microbial door prize courtesy of the White House?
The abolitionist David Walker wrote a prayer that started “Oh Lord, please deliver us from the white Christians.”

The only other option is that he has a case bad enough to require hospitalization but bounces back so quickly he can hit the trail again within 2 weeks.
Does anybody think that’s realistic?
That’s why the lies and misdirection surrounding the timing of his diagnosis are so frustrating.
We have no idea how quickly this is actually happening.
Yes.
So the campaign is effectively over and the last time the public saw this dude he was snarling, screaming and insulting his opponent’s son for having a drug problem. Nice parting image.
Stephen Miller fear-tweeting as he awaits his own test results.
Wowww
I can’t believe he just said this. No, for real.
I can’t believe *he* just said this.
Damn.
Asked why they refuse to mention Herman Cain’s death they fall back on the reflex answer “He should’ve stopped resisting the police.”
Even Ralph Ellison would be shocked by this shit tho.
Why is this still happening?
So a month before the most crucial election of our lives we have a COVID cluster working it way through the White House, an infected president and a challenger who spent 90 minutes in a room with multiple likely contagious people.
We’re living in an episode of “24.”
Uh yeah.
He literally said they haven’t had any problems come out of the rallies.
Like they’d already forgotten that Cain died.
True, true.
Think whatever you want but tweeting ill wishes or voicing a hope for his demise is likely the stupidest thing you can do right now.
There’s a case for releasing this early.
Like tonight.
Forget any hope of criticizing the undergrads for ANY violation of the protocols.
I believe it was fuck.
As in “who gives a fuck about Christmas.”
Did we not visit this question when Ronny Jackson held that office?
This is the problem with having a chronic, prolific liar in office.
He submitted a fake letter about his health during the 2016 election.
There’s zero reason to take his word for anything.
I’m not saying this is false but we certainly should not presume it to be true on the basis of a tweet from him.
It was already clear that the debates were a waste of time but now there’s no real justification for having more of them.
Chris Wallace should be tested immediately too even just to gauge the risk of people in that room on Tuesday.
2020 is James Brown throwing off the cape.
Keep Pelosi in an isolation chamber.
I woulda bought you a gift but, y’know...
Are we sure this is true?
I only saw one episode.
Gonna give it one more before deciding.
Where can I find the original?
Watched Utopia because I had insomnia.
Trying to decide what I think of Episode 1.
Right.
Wait, I didn’t know there was a UK version.
Is it streaming someplace?
Is anyone else watching Utopia?
No, actual oatmeal with pb and a dash of j.
Hola!
Congrats!
Right. Mine has been all over the map since March.
I’ve given up and decided that I’m just up virtuously early.
good luck with the recovery!
Yep.
Ha!
peanut butter &amp; jelly oatmeal with coconut milk.
if it doesn’t cure insomnia it at least makes me feel better about being awake.
There’s that.
That end-stage level of insomnia where even your friends on the West Coast are asleep already...
This.
*Losing
Or even, as Tom Friedman said, refuse to continue any further debates until he releases his taxes.
I think you’re right.
The Biden people are probably concerned about looking like they’ve backed out and he’s afraid of Trump but in reality they’ve won and have nothing left to prove.
For kinfolk, yes. But skinfolk don’t believe in all that.
I’ve often heard it said that to whom much is given, much is required. 
But not the other part: to whom nothing is given we expect even more.
The person who told Biden to keep looking at the camera and addressing the viewers deserves a raise. 
Every time he started a sentence with “Folks” it was like he was breaking the 4th wall on the world’s shittiest reality tv program.
The next #VERZUZ should be skinfolk vs. kinfolk.
Smiling and shuffling would be more dignified than this act.
Trump was using interruptions last night the way a loser boxer uses a clench — an attempt to stop the action that you don’t have an answer for and that is putting your opponent ahead on the scorecards.
I said the same.
One Country For Old Men
Future moderators need to have the capacity to cut off the mics.
But not really tho.
The thugs I knew really were about that life.
But this dude only talks a big game.
The phrase is “Keep my son’s name out your mouth.”
I saw that. Weak.
I’m referring to the interruptions.
Chris Wallace taking a lot of heat for his moderation but I’m not sure how he could reign in the red-faced one short of cutting his mic.
If you give me $5 million I’ll tell you.
(Wait, I just did.)
You ain’t know?
Whoever told him to keep looking at the camera and saying “This guy is lying to you” is smart.
Otherwise it would lapse into just two old guys yelling on tv.
Would it be worth it?
Just once I want someone to look at Trump after he’s insulted their family member and say “Mention my son/daughter/wife/father again and we’ll finish this debate in the parking lot.”
Pretty sure Ben Gay is going to surge in the polls tomorrow.
I’m thrilled to have been able to participate on the jury.
A well-deserved and timely recognition for work whose import has only become more apparent.
The odd thing about this whole “Park Avenue vs Scranton” thing is that the incumbent is going to get blown out on Park Avenue, uptown and downtown.
If anything, he’s likely to be more competitive in Scranton.
From a standpoint of scandal it almost would’ve been better for him to have paid zero than to pay $750.
The pittance is an insult in its own right.
As @JoyAnnReid pointed out, the number is memorable.
Everyone knows just how much money that is, or rather isn’t.
Not that there wasn’t already cause for concern but a narcissistic fear of humiliation is now even more closely paired with legal liability as reasons trump could do absolutely anything, including use of force, in the coming election.
Our situation has grown even more dangerous.
Other scenario that occurred to me: after 4 years antagonizing and persecuting civil service employees his future will be in the hands of them should he lose this election.
It’ll also be interesting to see what a Biden DOJ or IRS would do with this situation.
Secondary implications for this story are the Trump offspring.
They may not care that the likelihood of him leaving office in ignominy is higher.
But the likelihood of him going broke immediately afterward tho...
Michael Cohen wearing Trump out on MSNBC.
"In the year he paid $750 in taxes I paid more than $3 million.
If I went to jail for 3 years for tax evasion he should get 300 years."
That sound you just heard was Bernie Sanders benchpressing 450 lbs just to, y’know, vent.
To be a fly on Tish James’s wall right now...
This part.
It’s odd that some people think this is debatable.
National sovereignty is a fairly low prerequisite for superpower status.
Can you really say that about a country whose elections are besieged by foreign intervention and whose leadership does nothing about it?
yes, because men who have daughters are never sexist.
The United States is not a super power.
Damn, this really got to me.
This person not only helped a cancer survivor regain her strength, he performed a service to American Democracy, such as that term applies.
Damn. 
For some unknown reason polls show Georgia now leaning toward Biden...
Wow.
As evidenced by the fact that you couldn’t even find a black PR person to tell you not to say this dumb sh*t.
I think by “his community” they mean white people.
This isn’t even surreal anymore.
Its just stupid.
