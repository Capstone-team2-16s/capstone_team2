@HBOMax Thank you, #GiftFromHBOMax
Was never in Walking Dead.
What? My daughter better not be on Twitter.
She should be doing her homework. 📚
Tragic. My sincere condolences to her family.
The vines were definitely talking to me. 🍷 #FromTheVine #FromTheVineMovie
Thank you @GoldwynFilms .
Also watching #RatchedNetflix .
Just gorgeous.
The acting is stellar (as expected)! 👏🏾  
I saw #TheLastIce early; it’s wonderful!
Documentary feature that chronicles Inuit communities fighting to keep their culture alive by protecting the rapidly melting Arctic that has been their home for centuries.
Premieres on Nat Geo WILD Monday October 12th!
Got an early preview of @Showtime ‘s #TheGoodLordBird .
It’s a series you’ll keep thinking about...always a good sign.
And it’s timely. Releases on Showtime - October 4th.
Check it out if you have the chance. 👍🏽
Negative.
They are not.
😘❤️ you!
Happy Birthday to everyone born in October! 🎂🍾🎁🎈🎉🛍
Ever since “she” lived in Switzerland and Africa.
😘 my friend.
I missed you, @ItsPaigeTurco ! ❤
Great scene with @linzzmorgan .
#The100
May we meet again, centipede 🐛 in another lifetime — perhaps — when we are both cats.
Okay, I’m paraphrasing VANILLA SKY.
Probably a sign for me to go to bed.
#The100
Short for Behind the scenes.
Honestly, I felt terrible for #The100 hair & makeup department, especially when it would rip in a battle or fight scene.
They really worked hard on it.
Hair story 8) Once I wrapped #OBXNetflix , it made much more sense to “buzz it all off.”
And that is the hair story of S7 #The100 .
Hair story 7) this was during the early episodes of #The100 S7 so it was hot & sometimes the bald cap would tear.
And we’d have to do it all over again.
Hair story 6) so everyday, this is what hair & makeup did to accommodate my hair needs.
#The100
Hair story 5) They’d start by making me a bald cap, painting it to match my skin and once dry, apply and glue hair pieces to the bald cap to match my S6 #The100 hair.
Hair story 4) Soooo...
The wonderful folks in #The100 ‘s hair and makeup department had to “build” my hair.
This consisted of many hours work — every day.
Hair story 3) This is normal.
Shows need continuity.
My #The100 hair was completely different from my hair in #OBXNetflix so it was an issue.
Hair story 2) #The100 needed my S7 hair to match my S6 hair.
#OBXnetflix needed my hair to match what it had looked like in previous episodes and scenes.
Thank you!!!! for all your hard work.
Hope we can work together soon.
Much Love
Hair story 1) I was shooting #OBXnetflix in South Carolina during the early episodes of S7 of #The100.
Hurricane hit in South Carolina which delayed our shooting schedule.
And now I owe you all the “hair story...” #The100
#The100 BTS .
It was such a gorgeous place to film.
I love and miss you, Vancouver. ❤️ 🇨🇦
#The100 BTS One of the best actors and a terrific human.
#The100 BTS My “daughters”.
#The100 BTS I adore these women! ❤️❤️❤️
This is a first for me. BTS pictures from #The100 .
All of the music in this episode was outstanding.
#The100
It’s a series wrap.
You were great, Lola.
#The100
#ForAllMankind - that’s why Indra was wearing jeans.
#The100
I love this Octavia scene so much.
#The100
Totally forgot.
This looping work was done from home due to Covid-19.
#The100
I missed you, @ItsPaigeTurco ! ❤️
Great scene with @linzzmorgan .
#The100
Probably when she built the water park.
#The100
Nope.
We already broke the internet once.
Nope I’m still 🤐 on that.
Pretty sure you can figure out the show if you google.
Nope.
Yes.
Stay for a while.
I’m going to do something I’ve NEVER done... post BTS pictures.
#The100
Will we see puppy-monkey-baby in the finale? 🤔
#The100
Oh forgot my disclaimer.
If you haven’t watched #The100 finale yet, please mute me to avoid spoilers.
I’ve been staring at my sake for three hours, trying to open it with my mind.
It didn’t work.
I’m opening it toasting #The100 .
Time to see how it all ends. 🍶&🥣
Thank you & congratulations to @JRothenbergTV on 100 episodes of #The100 .
I’m celebrating #The100 finale — not with soup — but sake (and a Vancouver t-shirt).
Three minute warning.
Get your snacks, wash your hands.
I’ll be back at 8 pm pacific time to watch the series finale.
P.S. 🥣 is still good.
😘
Thanks, Emily.
My mentions are so very sweet today.
Thank you to all the fans of #The100 . 😘 ❤️
Hair story will be told after #The100 finale ends on west coast, as promised.
Going to be hard to fit into one tweet.
New job has been delayed a bit.
Waiting for virus protocols to be implemented.
Everyone is working to keep cast & crew safe.
I have a couple things to post later tonight after #The100 finishes airing on the west coast.
Bittersweet day.
#The100 final episode is tonight.
This show has some of the greatest fans — EVER — from all over the world.
This is for you guys & girls:
Yes it is.
Story of an amazing family.
🙏🏾 for the gifts you left behind.
Love a reason to get dressed up...
So proud to have been a part of that series, #Underground  
Bravo #LovecraftCounty
Who is nervous about #The100 series finale?
Indra has been “stress eating.” 🤣
Watched a wonderful documentary #CakesOfVersailles about using modern day creativity to honor Versailles.
And — like Versailles also see the decadence & inhumanity that lead to its demise.
Got my creative juices flowing!
Thanks @IFCFilms
Watching National Geographic’s “Magic of Disney’s Animal Kingdom. 
Disney Conservation Fund (DCF), inspired by Walt Disney’s conservation legacy helps protect wildlife & wild places around the world.
We are fascinated...and...pizza 🍕!
Sending out a BIG Congrats to #BillieLourd and #AustenRydell on the new arrival!
Very happy news. 🤗❤️🍾🎉
Is it unintentional? 😉
Giving this a boost.
There are probably a lot of #The100 fans who will enjoy it.
Thanks @McKenzieLyn , Fandomize and my cast mates.
#MayWeVoteAgain 
Time to check the homework.
Thanks for watching #The100 with me.
👆🏾more left. Wow! 
Later, 🐊’s.
I had a few “difficult” scenes in True Blood (for personal reasons.) AHS — you’ve ALWAYS gotta bring your A game.
And — The Newroom because that’s the nature of Sorkin dialogue.
It’s fairly normal to have different directors for different episodes — on most shows.
Now that I have your attention, could everyone (in the United States) please, please, please VOTE. 🗳
Make a plan to vote.
And make a backup plan to vote.
Then do it!
Ian Samoil did a wonderful job directing that episode.
I’m so grateful I was able to shadow him. 🤗
#The100
Something in S3 or one of the scenes in S7.
Gosh, @MisElizaJane has me crying again.
@iamAvgeropoulos too!
#The100
A very elite, celebrity chef.
#The100
Most? Hmm.
I liked that Indra was a different type character than I usually play — in a genre — I have never done before #The100 .
She would have succeeded in her real estate development business.
#The100
🤣 Then I’ve had many lives!
Indra would simply nod.
I, on the other hand, feel very happy to read this and want to say “Thank you.”
(See...we are different.)
Where is the jackhammer for goodness sakes?!
#The100
Mr. Blankenclear. In fact, I almost forgot about him.
#The100
Honestly, it’s been a rough day.
I love this young lady.
#The100
“West coast” (in America) means all the states in the U.S. that border the Pacific ocean. 
Does anyone have questions that don’t involve favorites?
#The100
🤣 No way!
That’s definitely a stretch.
Some “Bhagavad Gita” vibes in that discussion.
#The100
Oh I really liked that @Gap commercial during #The100 .
The soup is ready. 🥣
#The100 is on and I cannot spill my soup.
New #The100 is on !
So is the soup 🥣.
I’ll be watching at 8 PM Pacific Time.
Wanted to thank Director Ian Samoil for allowing me to shadow him during his episode and for being a great teacher!😘
Just heard the news about #BreonnaTaylor .
It physically pains me so I cannot imagine how difficult it was for her family to hear.
