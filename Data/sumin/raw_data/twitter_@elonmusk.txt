New SpaceX droneship will be called ‚ÄúA Shortfall of Gravitas‚Äù
Nothing can escape gravity, not even black holes (and they really tried!)
Would be cool to put yourself in the mind of the car while it‚Äôs driving
Coming soon
Call of Booty, great game
Vector-space bird‚Äôs eye view coming with FSD
Unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator
All of that and more.
We‚Äôre doing a broad review of launch site, propulsion, structures, avionics, range & regulatory constraints this weekend.
I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person.
Exactly
We will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing 48 launches next year!
I agree with Lex
Glad you‚Äôre ok!
Haha
Thanks for waiting!
Next year for sure
Oh yeah, Starship update coming in about 3 weeks.
The design has coalesced.
What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes.
High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
Great
Brownsville is quite far south, so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity ‚Äî needs several more Starlink launches.
I‚Äôm using it at the little house I rent in the area.
Definitely not good there yet.
Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) & more ground stations are deployed.
As we‚Äôre able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero.
Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
Yes, Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isn‚Äôt required for Mars, so 4 is possible
Yeah
Great letter!
It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as we‚Äôre actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine & scientific progress is not impeded.

Glad to hear your Mom is ok
Good to see.
Inspiring for future of space!
The new heat pump in Model Y is what really makes the difference in cold weather
Yes, coming soon
Great render!
The circumferential welds & skin panels will be much smoother in future builds.
That‚Äôs very hard to do.
Weld esthetics will improve greatly in upcoming Starships
Haha true.
Why do showers have such a wide range!?
!!
Yes
Light is not as fast as you‚Äôd think
Maybe we used too many magenta spotlights
Having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety
We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth & predictable.
Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha.
I‚Äôm a huge fan of small retail investors.
Will make sure they get top priority.
You can hold me to it.
Fate loooves irony haha
True
Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries!
For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing!
Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics.
Starship SN8 with rear body flaps
Nosecone & front flaps next week.
SN9 next month.
First flight is to 15km or ~50,000 ft
Centaur with a bow obviously
What can‚Äôt we predict?
Only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
Haha
Cybertruck, ATV, Roadster & Semi
C A R S
Probably
Haha
Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow.
This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.
We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG & CATL (possibly other partners too).
However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 & beyond unless we also take action ourselves.
The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood.
It‚Äôs 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes.
The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.
