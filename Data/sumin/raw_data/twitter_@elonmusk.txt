Launch in 5 minutes
Yeah, with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls
The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other
Dragon can also hover & land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety
Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety
Ok
Yeah, I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now.
Last week, I had symptoms of a minor cold.
I‚Äôve had some brutal flu/cold experiences, but this was mild & hopefully over.
Doing tests from several different labs, same time of day, administered by RN & am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold.
There is no official standard for PCR testing.
Not sure people realize this.
Both obv insanely great, too bad they had this pointless argument
Astronaut launch today!
No kids though
Hell of a wig collection too
It would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results
Worth reading this thread if you‚Äôre curious about rona testing
They should be imo.
If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it‚Äôs high/not-high.
There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes ‚Äúpositive‚Äù.
A little up & down.
Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy & cloudy head than coughing/sneezing.
DayQuil rocks.
In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive?
If I‚Äôm asking the wrong question, what is a better question?
!
Cool, but please be super cautious.
Expect two steps forward, one back.
Lot of new code was merged.
Just a scratch. We can buff it out.
Am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely I have a moderate case of covid.
My symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold.
NPCs all the way up
Ahem
Unless you‚Äôre on DMT

Big expansion of beta program in 6 to 8 weeks!
Interesting.
My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 & N3 (generic sars) at 24.
I get results of today‚Äôs test tomorrow.
Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results.
What‚Äôs honey?
Feels that way
This seems accurate
Cold symptoms are gone for now üòÄüöÄüí´

Heneghan makes a lot of sense.
Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford ü§£ü§£.
General public doesn‚Äôt realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.
The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load.
From what I can gather, you‚Äôre probably not infectious above 30 & you probably are below 25.
Sound about right?
This a great reference! Worth a read.
Case closed
Soon
Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey & above 40 is bs.
Will talk to several more labs.
There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.
Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 &amp; N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable &amp; above 40 cycles is not
Note, this is not the spike protein.
They don‚Äôt consider that reliable.
ust spoke directly to a testing lab.
Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2.
N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses.
High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles & 40 cycles is their max.
Strange
Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold & flu prevalence vs prior years.
If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms & falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.
Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be.
This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.
From https://t.co/42z7vRPB9c
Sure is
Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry.
What‚Äôs the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?
Interesting
Interesting
What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test & is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too.
Hard to get a straight answer. 
False positives will roughly scale with # of tests & daily test rate has gone ballistic:
Mild sniffles & cough & slight fever past few days.
Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.
Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so ‚ÄúElon Musk Tests Negative for Covid‚Äù is an equally correct title.
The ‚Äúrapid antigen test‚Äù from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.
The carousel turns ever faster
Yup
Exactly
Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
If it‚Äôs happening to me, it‚Äôs happening to others.
I‚Äôm getting PCR tests from separate labs.
Results will take about 24 hours.
Something extremely bogus is going on.
Was tested for covid four times today.
Two tests came back negative, two came back positive.
Same machine, same test, same nurse.
Rapid antigen test from BD.
Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok.
We‚Äôll have to swap out at least one of the engines.
Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold.
Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss.
We need to design out this problem.
We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present.
Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising.
Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise it‚Äôs going to pop the cork.

Those are relatively easy.

Einstein was great, but did not succeed at engineering (and he tried)
Yeah, that will be relatively easy, as so few users out in the ocean
Yes, although I didn‚Äôt expect the stock to rise so much so soon.
The reason for the stock options is that they‚Äôre needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years.
Super appreciate your support, Steve!
That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway.
Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May 2009, 5 months later.
Closest we got was about a month.
The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress & pain for a long time ‚Äî from mid 2017 to mid 2019.
Production & logistics hell.
I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail.
But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM & Chrysler were going bankrupt.
That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008.
Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night & we were 3 days away from bankruptcy.
I put in all money I had, didn‚Äôt own a house & had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.
Difficult time.
Yes
Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge
As soon as we get regulatory approval.
Hopefully, around middle of next year.
Right now, it takes about 5 mins to set up, but, with future improvements, probably less than 3 mins.
No technical knowledge needed.
Just point at open sky & plug in!
Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!
Didn‚Äôt realize that was possible.
No problem if there‚Äôs a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!
As soon as we get country approval.
This is required for each country individually, as no EU-wide approval system exists.
Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March.
Lower latitude states need more satellites in position, so probably January
Several thousand more Starlink beta participation invitations going out this week
New design is better with many minor tweaks.
Even the small details matter.

Very close to actual expected flight!
I could not be more excited about the new supercollider!
That said, while it is considerably larger, I don‚Äôt think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering.

Well, it‚Äôs basically a tank from the future that‚Äôs road-legal, so yeah
Tesla Texas team is making great progress! Giga Texas factory will be an asskicker.

This is what matters most
We‚Äôve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass
Lord of the ‚Ä¶
Yeah.
Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.
Minor
Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch, yaw & roll during descent, such that the ship is positioned well to relight, flip & land, would be a big win
But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible.
Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready.
Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great.
Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks & relight would be a major win.
Every 5 to 10 days
Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions.
Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments.
True for most beta releases in my experience.
Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard!
Doing ‚Äúneural nets‚Äù without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they‚Äôre doing.
Reality is the hardest sim.
Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too.
This build should be noticeably better with interventions

To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades.
Most of the factory had no equipment at all!
Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.
GM & Toyota took everything that worked & moved it to their other factories.
All that was left were broken bots & equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value.
But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots & brought the factory back to life.
And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left.
They took all good equipment & sold most of rest for scrap.

I‚Äôm in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then.
Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see.
Good point.
Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website.
Great pics!
That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
Yup. With beta updates, there‚Äôll be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast.
Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
Starship is coming together!
Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now.
One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released.
FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
There will be a 360 deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves.
How much time do you think we should give?
Agreed. Are these performance tires?
Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera.
Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case.
Sure
Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday
As soon as we complete testing & regulators approve.

Dependent on proving high safety
Not intentional!
We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state.
Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed.
We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt).

I mean, ya gotta have a tiki bar ‚Ä¶
Starship nosecone, high bay & tiki bar 
After it gets to orbit a few times
Got a little melty tbh :)
Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey.
Pushing it for near-term tests doesn‚Äôt achieve anything, but I‚Äôm confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights.
Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues.
210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes. 
R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area.
Will need bigger pumps.
FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should.
Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.

Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this.
Starship is designed to carry people & cargo around Earth (also to moon & Mars).
Vast majority of use will be civilian.
It‚Äôs just like an airline in space.
All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian.
With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn‚Äôt clear until we hit the ceiling.
This time, it‚Äôs right.
Thank you, much more accurate haha
Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate.
Almost every element of production is >75% automated.
Only wire harnesses & general assembly, which are <10% of production costs, are primarily manual.
Will release order configurator probably in Jan
Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. 
The SoC‚Äôs sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it‚Äôs fairly obvious when one is discordant
Tesla FSD computer‚Äôs dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes
they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.
Accurate analysis.

Our tiles are mechanically attached
It might be used in some areas.
ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.
Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too.
A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.

Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.
It‚Äôs already sensible for rocket engine parts.
To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.
Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note

Super Heavy stacking should begin around then.
That looks tasty!
The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
Sandy Munro understands engineering
That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica.
Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part.
Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one.
Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product
Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper & lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity & improved polar moment or inertia.
This is a *major* breakthrough.
But now we understand production much better.
It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009.
Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla.
No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years.
Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration.
You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it‚Äôs fun & takes ~100 people.
Production takes >10,000 people & hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg.
Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard.
Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve.
I can‚Äôt emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.
We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack & front & rear single piece castings.
Also, a new paint system.
Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk.
Fremont & Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven.
They are
I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart

This was a proof test, rather than a burst test.
We‚Äôll hopefully fix the leak today & retest.
Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking
One of the best shots ever!

Great photo!
It will soon
Once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US & hopefully southern Canada.
Other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval.
We‚Äôre not seeing notable differences yet.
I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights.
Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced.
Maybe turbopump hot sections.
Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that‚Äôs needed to meet max launch demand.
Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster & 3rd flight for active half of fairing.
Aiming for 10+ flights of booster & fairing by end of next year.

Looks good so far.
So crazy to subsidize pollution!
This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car‚Äôs exhaust pipe.
It‚Äôs a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026.
Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale.
Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.
Turn volume to 11 &amp; play Powerglide in your Tesla 
FSD will solve these issues
Music volume on a Tesla goes to 11, because it‚Äôs louder than 10
One of my favorite writers.
Foundation is tough to make into a movie, but has outstanding potential.

Rewatched Young Frankenstein this weekend.
Still awesome. Ovaltine?
The remake has the potential to be great.
I kinda liked the original tbh, but it‚Äôs possible to take it up a level.
Hollywood should just start with the sequel &amp; skip the original, because financials
This article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of 5 or more presently &amp; 10X long-term
Pretty wild, considering that Exxon was the most valuable company in the word when we went public 10 years ago
New SpaceX droneship will be called ‚ÄúA Shortfall of Gravitas‚Äù
Nothing can escape gravity, not even black holes (and they really tried!)
Would be cool to put yourself in the mind of the car while it‚Äôs driving
Coming soon
Call of Booty, great game
Vector-space bird‚Äôs eye view coming with FSD
Unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator
All of that and more.
We‚Äôre doing a broad review of launch site, propulsion, structures, avionics, range & regulatory constraints this weekend.
I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person.
Exactly
We will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing 48 launches next year!
I agree with Lex
Glad you‚Äôre ok!
Haha
Thanks for waiting!
Next year for sure
Oh yeah, Starship update coming in about 3 weeks.
The design has coalesced.
What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes.
High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
Great
Brownsville is quite far south, so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity ‚Äî needs several more Starlink launches.
I‚Äôm using it at the little house I rent in the area.
Definitely not good there yet.
Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) & more ground stations are deployed.
As we‚Äôre able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero.
Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
Yes, Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isn‚Äôt required for Mars, so 4 is possible
Yeah
Great letter!
It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as we‚Äôre actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine & scientific progress is not impeded.

Glad to hear your Mom is ok
Good to see.
Inspiring for future of space!
The new heat pump in Model Y is what really makes the difference in cold weather
Yes, coming soon
Great render!
The circumferential welds & skin panels will be much smoother in future builds.
That‚Äôs very hard to do.
Weld esthetics will improve greatly in upcoming Starships
Haha true.
Why do showers have such a wide range!?
!!
Yes
Light is not as fast as you‚Äôd think
Maybe we used too many magenta spotlights
Having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety
We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth & predictable.
Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha.
I‚Äôm a huge fan of small retail investors.
Will make sure they get top priority.
You can hold me to it.
Fate loooves irony haha
True
Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries!
For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing!
Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics.
Starship SN8 with rear body flaps
Nosecone & front flaps next week.
SN9 next month.
First flight is to 15km or ~50,000 ft
Centaur with a bow obviously
What can‚Äôt we predict?
Only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
Haha
Cybertruck, ATV, Roadster & Semi
C A R S
Probably
Haha
Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow.
This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.
We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG & CATL (possibly other partners too).
However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 & beyond unless we also take action ourselves.
The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood.
It‚Äôs 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes.
The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.
