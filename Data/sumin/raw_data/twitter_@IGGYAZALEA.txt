Babies sleep in weird ass positions, 
Your back don’t hurt bro?
😝
I don’t wanna “become a YouTuber” just think it could be fun to post videos from time to time that are not music related.
Def gonna do it! But probably in 2021 since this year is cursed. 💖
Wow this is really cute, I love it 😻
Any other moms who can’t stop dropping weight after having a baby?
(Not a brag, genuinely wanna hear if you had this happen) 
I don’t try/want to lose weight but it’s literally just shedding off me, is it hormonal?
Should I be concerned? 20lbs lighter than pre baby and counting
💖
Bro I was ready!
2020 I came to fight!
Literally!
I got half the procedure right but then driving home I realized I forgot a really important step that could’ve made our situation so much better.
Like bitch!!!
I could’ve saved our lives way better! 
But it’s hard to remember what to do in emergencies when they are happening.
You forget stuff that’s simple.
FUCK! At least it wasn’t real life. 😹😩🥴
you can count on me to kinda safe a life.
I have moderately good ideas.
So I thought I was in a life or death emergency today (long story, I’ll explain later, I wasn’t)
I was happy I got a lot of the safety procedure correct - but then driving home I realized I forgot the BIGGEST part/first thing I’m meant to do. 
And now I’m kicking myself! Argh!
Facts! 👁👄👁
Til my ears bleed!
Also 300 lawsuits sounds wildly entertaining I can’t wait to watch trump lose 300 more times!
She is the main character! 
Suddenly I love 2020
Every time I see everyone celebrating I just cry I’m so fucking happy! Wooooooo!!!! 
The plot twist we all needed. 
These 2020 writers really ended the show on a high note, I loved the season finale.
Beyond.
This is the America I wanted to come and be a part of again.
Thankyou to everyone who voted, on behalf of so many of us who live here but can not.

There is no COVID cure babe stay updated, they’ve already said you won’t be getting that.
Most you can expect is better medication for treatment.
Voting stats say that it’s facts but go off.
The best part is most of the trump ppl live in bumble fuck nowhere so they aren’t in the city to fuck up our celebrations

@queenkimeow Nah I have years before I will be able to, you have to have held a green card for a while before becoming eligible.
I hate Donald trump and if you like him: I hate you too. 
Now what.
No, you can’t vote with a green card.
