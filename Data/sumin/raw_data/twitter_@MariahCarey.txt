Happy Anniversary Daydream 😍 🎵 and I lay in bed all night and I was...🎵 
My executive assistant at the time thought it was a "ditzy" title for an album.
I'm glad I didn't listen to her or the rest of the corporate morgue.
All I did at the time was daydream, sing and endure a lot of bleakness.
It remains one of my favorite albums to this day 💖
Cyndi, you have always had love from me!!!
I will never forget on my 21st birthday (back when I still had birthdays), when you gave me a beautiful orange lyric book and I wrote the entire Music Box album in it. It meant so much to me as do you and your talent! ❤️❤️❤️
Following 👀
The best one!!! 😂
Rocky and I are asking @alexa99 to tell us what "Mariah's thought of the day is" gotta admit it's pretty fun 😂

I am feeling so grateful for you tonight and I will never forget that you "carried me through desperation".
"I still exist because... ...you're always there for me" ❤️🐏❤️🐏
Tune in to ‘The Meaning Of Mariah Carey: Looking In.
Narrating the audiobook for my memoir was such a special experience for me.
It not only brought me closer to the words on the page, but to some of my own song lyrics as well.
Laugh, cry and sing along with me as you're listening to #TMOMC 
Butterflies in my stomach but pride in my heart.
Tears of joy for little Mariah whose story gets to be heard for the first time. I've been waiting for today my entire life. #TMOMC 📖💝
Full blown tears at 2am 😭😭😭 thank you for always being #ThereForMe ❤️❤️❤️
“I refuse to acknowledge time...”
Dear Divine Miss M! Your memoir and tissues are with our trusted mail system 📫😘💖 
I did! 😉
You should actually get the audio book, Diane!
Our song plays an integral part in it 😘 (and your copy's on the way bitch!)
I appreciate you so much 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for a great first date, Stephen!
I promise not to cancel any holidays without checking with you first 😘 @StephenAtHome
I sent you a copy too! ❤️❤️
Today is the last day for some people to call my friends and reps to see if they're in the book or not LOL
#TheMeaningOfMariahCarey IS OUT TOMORROW!!! 🥳🥂
Fun fact 2: now that you've listened to Clarissa's kick-ass lead vocals, I can tell you that I'm on a quest to unearth the version of this album with my lead vocals and will not stop until we find it! So happy that we get to experience this together lol! 🐑❤🎸
I can't 😂😂😂😂
I'm so happy yet thoroughly amused that my little "alternative"/"grunge" album is finally out there for the fans 😂
Rock on!!! 🎸🎸🎸🎸
Fun fact: I did an alternative album while I was making Daydream 👀
Just for laughs, but it got me through some dark days.
Here's a little of what I wrote about it in #TheMeaningOfMariahCarey 🤟
S/O to my friend Clarissa who performs the lead w/ me as a hidden layer #Chick #TMOMC
👀🐏🔍👏🤘🎧❤️
#Lambily, there was a lil Easter egg in my Out Here On My Own lyric video that you may not have noticed 😉

I couldn't have asked for a better way to introduce my memoir than having a conversation with my friend, therapist and icon Ms. @Oprah Winfrey, on her series #TheOprahConversation.
