Since it’s getting colder, we decided to add some new items for the winter months.
New merch available on my store 💙x
#BrightestBlue is now GOLD in the US 📀
2020 has been a challenge but the love that you've shown with this new record has certainly outweighed the negative.
I'm  hopeful that we can be together soon but for now, wash your hands, wear a mask, stop bloody mingling & VOTE! 💙x

Conscious means awake and fully responsive to every signal the planet sends us.
Only then can we act with enough conviction. #StellaSummer21 💓

What’s your favourite song from #Halcyon? x
It was such a beautiful time of launching myself into the unknown, giving no f*cks, not knowing what the hell I was doing and living day to day off your energy.
I can’t wait for this feeling again, god knows it’s time for the joy of live music again.
So many of you have joined me on this ride and have stuck with me all the way and I’m so grateful for all of you.
I have the most insane memories of absolute chaos and serene-ness at the same time of being on tour with Halcyon and seeing all of you there.
Thank you to @bmi @BMILondon for popping these in the post- 9 awards and 7 US pop awards to date, thanks for the continued love & support.
Dedicating these ones to you Juice.
