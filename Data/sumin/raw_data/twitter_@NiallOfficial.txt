Nice little trend to wake up to. Time ifs flying by and I can’t believe it’s been 3 years already.
Glad you loved the record and everything that came with it.
Thank you for everything. #3YearsOfFlicker

There are 4 different streams so you can watch the one most convenient to you.
Please help me support the amazing people whose work in touring has been severely affected .
Yes it’s been an incredible response .
A few awful responses that are frustrating to read as these people don’t know the ins and outs of our industry and how things are costed up etc .
Let’s forget about them and have a great time
I didn’t notice until this video 😂
I’m sooo happy to share that I’ll be playing a special one-off livestream show from London’s legendary @RoyalAlbertHall on Nov 7 !
