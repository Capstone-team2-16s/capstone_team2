We are a community of Warrior/Survivors &amp; we will stand together for however long it takes to stop this abuse & ensure all children are safe & getting the care they deserve.🙌
#iSeeYouSurvivor #BreakingCodeSilence ❤ 🎥 @KevinOstaj
When I was a teenager I promised myself that one day I was going to shut down #ProvoCanyonSchool &amp; save all the children.
And I am so proud that I have finally built up the courage to tell my story and live up to that promise.
This is just the beginning.
There's nothing more powerful than coming out and being who you are.

Showing our abusers that we will no longer be silent & expose them for all the evil terrible things that they have done.
Taking back our power & making it loud & clear that this child abuse needs to end!
Thank you all yesterday for your kind words of love & encouragement.
Yesterday was one of the most empowering moments of my life!

And I hope by telling my story can help you heal, tell your story and set yourself free.
We can no longer be silent.
