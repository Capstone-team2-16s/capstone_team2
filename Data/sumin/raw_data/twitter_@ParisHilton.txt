@ @ 💔😭 That was heartbreaking
This is so heartbreaking. 💔 
hese children don’t deserve this.
🥺@UHS_Inc should be ashamed of themselves to allow this to happen!
This abuse needs to stop! #BreakingCodeSilence
We are a community of Warrior/Survivors &amp; we will stand together for however long it takes to stop this abuse & ensure all children are safe & getting the care they deserve.🙌
#iSeeYouSurvivor #BreakingCodeSilence ❤ 🎥 @KevinOstaj
When I was a teenager I promised myself that one day I was going to shut down #ProvoCanyonSchool &amp; save all the children.
And I am so proud that I have finally built up the courage to tell my story and live up to that promise.
This is just the beginning.
There's nothing more powerful than coming out and being who you are.

Showing our abusers that we will no longer be silent & expose them for all the evil terrible things that they have done.
Taking back our power & making it loud & clear that this child abuse needs to end!
Thank you all yesterday for your kind words of love & encouragement.
Yesterday was one of the most empowering moments of my life!

Provo Canyon School has faced allegations of abuse and mistreatment since its founding.
lt is time we demand accountability.
Provo along with the countless other facilities aren’t going to be able to get away with this anymore.

One day you will tell your story of how you overcame what you went through and it will be someone else’s survival guide.❤️

Hello fellow survivors, parents, family members of survivors &amp; former &amp; current staff members.
My team & I are collecting information of stories of abuse that has happened & is still happening at these “schools” in the the #TroubledTeenIndustry.

But I need your help.

So incredibly proud to have shared my story and truth in #ThisIsParis 🎥
I want to thank you all for your outpour of love and support.
I was so scared and did not know what to expect having never been so open and real in my entire life.
My new mission in life is to do everything in my power to shut these places down so that no other child has to go through what we went through.
And I hope by telling my story can help you heal, tell your story and set yourself free.
We can no longer be silent.
It’s time to expose them and protect the next generation.
Love you all❤ #BreakingCodeSilence 🖤

Is there anything she can’t handle?
She’s been broken. She’s been knocked down.
She’s felt the pain that most couldn’t handle.
She looks fear in the face. She never hides.
And she always finds a way to get back up. She’s a #Warrior. 🖤
