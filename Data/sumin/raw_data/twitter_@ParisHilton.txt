Up late doing some more research on @ProvoCanyon.
In tears, more memories flooding back of the torture &amp; abuse I suffered there. 🥺

Provo Canyon School has faced allegations of abuse and mistreatment since its founding.
lt is time we demand accountability.
Provo along with the countless other facilities aren’t going to be able to get away with this anymore.
Thank you to my #Survivor Family for being so brave and courageous telling your stories to @InsideEdition.
We will no longer be silent. #UnitedWithOneVoice 🙌 #iSeeYouSurvivor #BreakingCodeSilence
One day you will tell your story of how you overcame what you went through and it will be someone else’s survival guide.❤️

Hi Thomas, thank you for the lovely message.

Happy Anniversary my love!
I feel like the luckiest girl in the world because I have you. 🥰
You opened my heart in ways I didn’t existed.
You are the most extraordinary person I’ve ever met.
You transformed my life in so many ways.
They need to be exposed &amp; held accountable for their deplorable actions.

Hello fellow survivors, parents, family members of survivors &amp; former &amp; current staff members.
My team & I are collecting information of stories of abuse that has happened & is still happening at these “schools” in the the #TroubledTeenIndustry.
Hey guys, I’m doing another #TikTok Live this week for my #ThatsHot Series. ❤️

Any suggestions? 🤔

But I need your help.

We never dreamed that it would, in fact, be ourselves, as adults. 🖤 #iSeeYouSurvivor #BreakingCodeSilence

😍 Thank you love ☺️
Thank you🥺 I appreciate that❤️
I don’t want to burn anything.
But I would love to shut them down because that’s what they deserve.
And thank you I’m so happy you enjoyed my documentary. 🙏 #breakingcodesilence
So incredibly proud to have shared my story and truth in #ThisIsParis 🎥
I want to thank you all for your outpour of love and support.
I was so scared and did not know what to expect having never been so open and real in my entire life.
My new mission in life is to do everything in my power to shut these places down so that no other child has to go through what we went through.
And I hope by telling my story can help you heal, tell your story and set yourself free.
We can no longer be silent.
It’s time to expose them and protect the next generation.
Love you all❤ #BreakingCodeSilence 🖤

Is there anything she can’t handle?
She’s been broken. She’s been knocked down.
She’s felt the pain that most couldn’t handle.
She looks fear in the face. She never hides.
And she always finds a way to get back up. She’s a #Warrior. 🖤
