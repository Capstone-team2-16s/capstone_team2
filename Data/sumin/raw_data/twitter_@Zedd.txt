can I mix it for u
In n out is never not a good idea
That is correct.
I do still write me down, I’m just not limited by them ;)
Jon & Vinny’s is an S-TIER suggestion!
Ok - putting tacos in potential winners here.
I still have time.
We’re talking dinner.
I might pass on that one, chief
Fam do u have any caloric information on your pizzas?
Cheat meal today!!!!
What should I have????
Really all you hear in the car is third eye blind
Submission for the INSIDE OUT remix contest is now officially closed!
I can finally announce that EACH of the 3 winners will receive $10000 on top of an official release on @Interscope !
HUGE thanks to @discord for hosting this and thank YOU for submitting over 650 remixes!!!
❤️
Making progress 💪
I'M HERE ANSWERING QUESTIONS RIGHT NOWWWW! 
......it is literally a cash prize
♥️
I already mentioned that to my team. 
I literally don’t even own the rights to my music since I’m signed to interscope. 
Apparently the contract was drafted between my legal team and discord’s legal team.
Makes 0 sense to me but there probably is some reason why it’s that way ig
I apologize for getting heated.
And I apologize for the language in there being so misleading. 
I’m not a lawyer and don’t understand why it is written as is.
I’m sure it could have been done much better.
100% agree it’s super misleading.
I have no clue why it is written as is- this is what the lawyers of all parties agreed to.
I don’t know why.
The fact is that we were told not to mention the cash prize for legal reasons so we didn’t.
I’m not a lawyer.
1) I don’t own the rights to the remixes- interscope does as they own all rights to my own music and all remixes. 
2) I didn’t write the legal language obviously, but I AGREE it’s terribly misleading 
3) there is a cash prize for all 3 winners but it is illegal to disclose
YES there is!
CAN YOU NOT READ?
I’m literally stating that the legal language is there to protect all parties!!
I’m saying I DID remixes and played shows for free- not that other people are meant to do that. 
Don’t be ignorant.
(And that top part is NOT me btw!)
if u’re just trying to get clout and your Twitter coins: congratulations.
If u’re actually interested in the reality:
The is a large compensation for all 3 winners.
The legal language is confusing and imo entirely misleading but we were told not to disclose it the prize amount
For it to be an international contest the cash amount CANNOT be disclosed as it’s above the allowed max amount for all countries to be a part of it (see below).
If u wanna know more there’s more details on discord.
No it’s not.
I definitely agree the wording could have been done way clearer.
But I’m not a lawyer and certainly don’t write these “rules” or know the laws. 
I was asked to choose between announcing the cash prize and make it US only or not mention it and make it international.
ownership is gonna be interscope, as they 1) gonna release the remixes and 2) own the rights to my music and all remixes of my songs
Your mind will be BLOWN when u find out what the winners actually get.
U can read up on the issue of why you’re not allowed to announce prizes that are above a certain number here:
I agree with you 100%. 
It saddens me a lot when people talk shit about discord or myself while they absolutely don’t know anything about how things work.
I obviously wasn’t involved in any of the legal language but I agree it looks weird.
The reality is very different though.
Discord legal didn’t allow us to announce the winner cash prizing for an INTERNATIONAL contest cuz it was in excess of a certain amount for certain countries
Trust me.
I was really bummed when I was told I can’t announce the best part of the contest.
Because I wanted this to be accessible for ALL countries and not just the US.
I don’t get the legal bullshit and if it was up to me it would have been clearly announced to everyone but apparently that was not legal proof.
in other words - discord IS providing an HUGE price for the 3 winners.
I don’t understand the legal side of it but before u judge, there is more to it than u think.
Trust me- the winners will be very happy and u can take their word for it.
Discord legal notified us that we could not announce cash prizing because outside of the US you have to adhere to each countries rules for prizing and some do not allow cash prizing and some don’t allow it in excess of a certain amount.
DOING MY FIRST @reddit AMA TOMORROW!
I’m gonna select 1 PERSON who RETWEETS and replies why I should choose YOU to win this signed NEW @Xbox controller AND a 6 month Ultimate Xbox Game Pass.

You DON’T have to pick a side.

GOOD MORNIIIING
She made me so mad I stopped playing OW and started playing valorant and my anger issues went away 🤣

What are ur sens??
I’m 800dpi, 0.285. ... but I play inverted 😋
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
Of course it’s not Anthony.
The work is just starting.
But with a President who isn’t racist and xenophobe himself the work CAN start.
THAT was (in my opinion quite obviously) my point...
I’d hope you agree with that?
No! Of course not.
Didn’t say that either lol.
What’s better about postmates?
I’ve historically only used postmates but people tell me uberEATS is better.
Whats the diff ?
No. But the end is going to start now!
UberEATS or Postmates?
TIME TO HEAL
Correct.
Yes
👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
nah
I’m talking about the President. Not the world.
And to the ones who say I didn’t respect Trump:
Correct.
I didn’t respect him and I never will. 
Respect isn’t given. Respect is earned.
*complimentary. Nothing is free in life ;)
Ok bruh but I love it.
I looooove it. :)))))
wish i could explain better how much but just ... max level love it
If you are unhappy with the outcome of this election I’m sorry for your anger.
Trust me.
I know the feeling.
I’ve felt it for 4 years.
Correct.
Sorry I didn’t have the old patch notes on me.
But yes correct- it went down 100% because over the last four years we were experimenting with very high numbers
It’s the patch notes bro.
We’re monitoring the stability of the game.
Our devs have been hard at work.
Give it a chance.
Play v46.1 a bit more - we think it runs really smooth
True.
But today I celebrate.
So... join me or leave!
That’s wrong, Donny. 
You’re the red bar, not the blue bar. 
Your name is NOT Joe Biden.
You are “Trump”- the one with “MILLIONS AND MILLIONS” of votes LESS. 😋
AMERICA got a huge buff today.
Patch notes below:
• dignity: +100%
• racism: -100% 
• introduced new feature called “science”
• removed “lying” from the game as it felt too effective
• added a tool called “hope” to ramp up character moral 
• made “future” a bit brighter
Hey @realDonaldTrump:
YOU’RE FIRED!!!
CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA 🇺🇸!
CONGRATULATIONS WORLD 🌎!
CONGRATULATIONS HUMANITY 🧬!
I LOVE YOU BERNIE!!!
What “legacy” is she referring to?
The one from a parallel universe I assume?
He did not. 
You however actually did, you lunatic 🤡!
Just let it be and save your money to defend yourself from going to jail for your remaining days.
U can lie all you want like you have been for 4 years but democracy is going to grab you right by the pussy.
Meet u there
Correct. I have enough.
I can give more.
My own interest isn’t my first interest.
I want to live in a country with dignity and a President who isn’t a lying sack of obesity. 
So, yes.
I’m happy to pay more taxes in exchange for everyone doing better.
GEORGIA G.O.A.T.s LET'S GO
LET’S GO, FAM. WE GOT THIS!!!
665. 
The neighbor of the beast. 
Literally.
* how many idiot trumpistan cult followers believe it. 
Actual decent human beings with a brain don’t believe it. His fans do.
🤣
I don’t care if he’s Democratic or Republican either.
I have no issue with Republicans!
I have an issue with racist CLOWNS like him who are abusing their power.
They’re @oakley
I was at MedBay
Checking in to say hello.

The only constant in my life is that my protein shake has 240 calories.
I JUST watched it.
Thought it was a really good speech!
I forgot what it feels like to not be embarrassed every time the president speaks.
FINALLY we’re on the same page.
we all want fraudulent votes to be discarded so that trump doesn’t cheat his way into office. :)))))
FUCK YOU TRUMP!
FUCK YOU!!!!!!!
LET‘S GO, JOE!!!!!!! LET‘S GOOO!!!!!!

🤫... https://t.co/eUvFN2d9cQ
Is Valorant ENTIRELY unplayable for anyone else?
Anytime I shoot in a combat the game constantly freezes - making it impossible to aim. 
Started w last patch... anyone else or is this an issue on my end???
ahahahahah
And I’m just a German who LIVES IN AMERICA and pays taxes IN AMERICA (not like trump) and I can say my opinion on trump being stupid as fuck when I want.
So again: either stick to your day job and out of politics or let others speak up wether they’re tow truck drivers or artists
I’m not either.
I’m talking about how fucking DUMB trump is.
He’s a celebrity and con man.
I wouldn’t say most people.
I’d say his supporters.
They certainly think substantially less than normal people. 🤣
U can’t ALWAYS twist the story to make it look like trump has brain cells.
Stick to your day job and stay out of politics.
Stick to your day job and stay out of politics.
There is absolutely no way you are actually THAT dumb
Absolute CLOWN of a „human being“ (<- that part is a stretch)
BRAND NEW SONG PREVIEW!!!!!!!
These look super sick dude!!!
how my year started vs how it’s going
I am proud of you!!!!
whoever forfeited that one match ruined my streak.
let’s go baby
Exactly the opposite of how it goes for me.
MAINGEAR are the GOATS
♥️♥️♥️
D’oh!
playing with friends usually
Actually !!!
Sometimes it do be like that
hahahah
one may argue I don't belong here https://t.co/HxN7dTLvKC
Miss u boys too ♥️
jake it’s not worth arguing with people who don’t believe in science.
It’s a waste of energy.
People believe what’s most convenient for them and WILL find some propaganda statistic, completely out of context & backwards, to back them up.
faith vs facts. it’s one or the other.
Oh no you can :)
Just right click on the track and “save instrument track”. 
I have them all saved from all songs so when I want the lead from “clarity” e.g. I just load it and it loads the VST, all plugins used, EQ Settings etc so it brings it back exactly how u had it prior
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
U can save entire “instrument tracks” (VST synth + all effects / EQs”).
I LOOOOOVE it man.
The devs are also amazing and genuinely listen to feedback and implement a lot of the ideas people request.
Support is fantastic. Software is very stable.
Lots of functionalities other daws don’t have.
Basically built in “melodyne” into every track etc etc etc
Cubase is BY FAR the best DAW imo. U can do anything with it.
It’s insanely precise and detailed. 
Ha… 
Here’s how
Yessir, in cubase you can do that very easily.
here is the full frame.
Let’s not talk about how unorganized my shoes are but HAPPY NATIONAL SNEAKER DAY

Hahaha that’s actually incredible
Let me know how it is / if it’s worth the upgrade 240
Wait whaaaat these are out already????
You’re the only Legday I approve.
This is NUTS!
Leg day SUCKS

Wtf
Good morning sunshine
Come pet them anytime u wish
Good morning 🐣
I think at 11pm pst today the patch is supposed to ship.
Today on stream we were able to have a calm conversation about politics while respecting each other’s different view points. 
It’s what we all need the most right now.
Compassion and our best attempt at understanding each other. 
The solution is usually somewhere in the middle.
Anytime

The things that make him look bad, the things he fucked up, the things he lied about... just those are “fake news”.
Any inconvenient truth about him is “fake news” ;)
