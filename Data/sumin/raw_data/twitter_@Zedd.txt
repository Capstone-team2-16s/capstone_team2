🤫... https://t.co/eUvFN2d9cQ
Is Valorant ENTIRELY unplayable for anyone else?
Anytime I shoot in a combat the game constantly freezes - making it impossible to aim. 
Started w last patch... anyone else or is this an issue on my end???
ahahahahah
And I’m just a German who LIVES IN AMERICA and pays taxes IN AMERICA (not like trump) and I can say my opinion on trump being stupid as fuck when I want.
So again: either stick to your day job and out of politics or let others speak up wether they’re tow truck drivers or artists
I’m not either.
I’m talking about how fucking DUMB trump is.
He’s a celebrity and con man.
I wouldn’t say most people.
I’d say his supporters.
They certainly think substantially less than normal people. 🤣
U can’t ALWAYS twist the story to make it look like trump has brain cells.
Stick to your day job and stay out of politics.
Stick to your day job and stay out of politics.
There is absolutely no way you are actually THAT dumb
Absolute CLOWN of a „human being“ (<- that part is a stretch)
BRAND NEW SONG PREVIEW!!!!!!!
These look super sick dude!!!
how my year started vs how it’s going
I am proud of you!!!!
whoever forfeited that one match ruined my streak.
let’s go baby
Exactly the opposite of how it goes for me.
MAINGEAR are the GOATS
♥️♥️♥️
D’oh!
playing with friends usually
Actually !!!
Sometimes it do be like that
hahahah
one may argue I don't belong here https://t.co/HxN7dTLvKC
Miss u boys too ♥️
jake it’s not worth arguing with people who don’t believe in science.
It’s a waste of energy.
People believe what’s most convenient for them and WILL find some propaganda statistic, completely out of context & backwards, to back them up.
faith vs facts. it’s one or the other.
Oh no you can :)
Just right click on the track and “save instrument track”. 
I have them all saved from all songs so when I want the lead from “clarity” e.g. I just load it and it loads the VST, all plugins used, EQ Settings etc so it brings it back exactly how u had it prior
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
U can save entire “instrument tracks” (VST synth + all effects / EQs”).
I LOOOOOVE it man.
The devs are also amazing and genuinely listen to feedback and implement a lot of the ideas people request.
Support is fantastic. Software is very stable.
Lots of functionalities other daws don’t have.
Basically built in “melodyne” into every track etc etc etc
Cubase is BY FAR the best DAW imo. U can do anything with it.
It’s insanely precise and detailed. 
Ha… 
Here’s how
Yessir, in cubase you can do that very easily.
here is the full frame.
Let’s not talk about how unorganized my shoes are but HAPPY NATIONAL SNEAKER DAY
♥️
Hahaha that’s actually incredible
Let me know how it is / if it’s worth the upgrade 240
Wait whaaaat these are out already????
You’re the only Legday I approve.
This is NUTS!
Leg day SUCKS
Ableton. No need to swap over if you’re comfortable.
What do you mean?
I thought he feels the best he’s felt in 20 years

Can we pls reduce the killjoy turret health to 50hp 🥺?
*Thick Fil A
I still don’t push people.
Yes.
Actually just talked to Joe a few days ago about it :)
APPLE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!
well isn’t this ironic...
Wtf
Good morning sunshine
Come pet them anytime u wish
Good morning 🐣
I think at 11pm pst today the patch is supposed to ship.
Today on stream we were able to have a calm conversation about politics while respecting each other’s different view points. 
It’s what we all need the most right now.
Compassion and our best attempt at understanding each other. 
The solution is usually somewhere in the middle.
Anytime

birthday halsssss
ha, well, the hardest thing about cypher for me is to not fall asleep :D
I play piano, drums, guitar and jett.
hahahahahahha
CLICK BELOW TO SEE ME LOSE EVERY GAME IN @PlayVALORANT !
Not everything is “Fake news”.
Only the things trump doesn’t like are.
The things that make him look bad, the things he fucked up, the things he lied about... just those are “fake news”.
Any inconvenient truth about him is “fake news” ;)
LEEEET’S GOOOO!!!!!!!
Time to raise some money for charity!!!! ♥️♥️♥️
TODAY!!!! 4PM PST

I’m so excited to be playing @FallGuysGame for such an important cause ❤️
