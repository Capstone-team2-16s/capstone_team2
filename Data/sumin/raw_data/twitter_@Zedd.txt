To everyone arguing over whether the new Xbox or PS5 is better:
THEY’RE BOTH AMAZING!!!
You DON’T have to pick a side.
Just shut up and GAME 🙃!
You’re just trying to find an excuse for why “your” console is better because u decided on one and not the other.
I just came ...
Yessir!! That’s where you’ll post your submission anyway. :)
More details / info on the process are in my
SOOOOO SICK

AHHHHHH 😍😍😍!!!!

Gonna sign and give away 1 controller and a 6 months Ultimate Xbox Game Pass so HANG TIGHT :)
What are ur sens??
I’m 800dpi, 0.285. ... but I play inverted 😋
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
Of course it’s not Anthony.
The work is just starting.
But with a President who isn’t racist and xenophobe himself the work CAN start.
THAT was (in my opinion quite obviously) my point...
I’d hope you agree with that?
No! Of course not.
Didn’t say that either lol.
What’s better about postmates?
I’ve historically only used postmates but people tell me uberEATS is better.
Whats the diff ?
No. But the end is going to start now!
UberEATS or Postmates?
TIME TO HEAL
Correct.
Yes
👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
nah
I’m talking about the President. Not the world.
And to the ones who say I didn’t respect Trump:
Correct.
I didn’t respect him and I never will. 
Respect isn’t given. Respect is earned.
*complimentary. Nothing is free in life ;)
Ok bruh but I love it.
I looooove it. :)))))
wish i could explain better how much but just ... max level love it
If you are unhappy with the outcome of this election I’m sorry for your anger.
Trust me.
I know the feeling.
I’ve felt it for 4 years.
Correct.
Sorry I didn’t have the old patch notes on me.
But yes correct- it went down 100% because over the last four years we were experimenting with very high numbers
It’s the patch notes bro.
We’re monitoring the stability of the game.
Our devs have been hard at work.
Give it a chance.
Play v46.1 a bit more - we think it runs really smooth
True.
But today I celebrate.
So... join me or leave!
That’s wrong, Donny. 
You’re the red bar, not the blue bar. 
Your name is NOT Joe Biden.
You are “Trump”- the one with “MILLIONS AND MILLIONS” of votes LESS. 😋
AMERICA got a huge buff today.
Patch notes below:
• dignity: +100%
• racism: -100% 
• introduced new feature called “science”
• removed “lying” from the game as it felt too effective
• added a tool called “hope” to ramp up character moral 
• made “future” a bit brighter
Hey @realDonaldTrump:
YOU’RE FIRED!!!
CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA 🇺🇸!
CONGRATULATIONS WORLD 🌎!
CONGRATULATIONS HUMANITY 🧬!
I LOVE YOU BERNIE!!!
What “legacy” is she referring to?
The one from a parallel universe I assume?
He did not. 
You however actually did, you lunatic 🤡!
Just let it be and save your money to defend yourself from going to jail for your remaining days.
U can lie all you want like you have been for 4 years but democracy is going to grab you right by the pussy.
Meet u there
Correct. I have enough.
I can give more.
My own interest isn’t my first interest.
I want to live in a country with dignity and a President who isn’t a lying sack of obesity. 
So, yes.
I’m happy to pay more taxes in exchange for everyone doing better.
GEORGIA G.O.A.T.s LET'S GO
LET’S GO, FAM. WE GOT THIS!!!
665. 
The neighbor of the beast. 
Literally.
* how many idiot trumpistan cult followers believe it. 
Actual decent human beings with a brain don’t believe it. His fans do.
🤣
I don’t care if he’s Democratic or Republican either.
I have no issue with Republicans!
I have an issue with racist CLOWNS like him who are abusing their power.
They’re @oakley
I was at MedBay
Checking in to say hello.

The only constant in my life is that my protein shake has 240 calories.
I JUST watched it.
Thought it was a really good speech!
I forgot what it feels like to not be embarrassed every time the president speaks.
FINALLY we’re on the same page.
we all want fraudulent votes to be discarded so that trump doesn’t cheat his way into office. :)))))
FUCK YOU TRUMP!
FUCK YOU!!!!!!!
LET‘S GO, JOE!!!!!!! LET‘S GOOO!!!!!!

Not worth it - you can’t invert mouse.

🤫... https://t.co/eUvFN2d9cQ
Is Valorant ENTIRELY unplayable for anyone else?
Anytime I shoot in a combat the game constantly freezes - making it impossible to aim. 
Started w last patch... anyone else or is this an issue on my end???
ahahahahah
And I’m just a German who LIVES IN AMERICA and pays taxes IN AMERICA (not like trump) and I can say my opinion on trump being stupid as fuck when I want.
So again: either stick to your day job and out of politics or let others speak up wether they’re tow truck drivers or artists
I’m not either.
I’m talking about how fucking DUMB trump is.
He’s a celebrity and con man.
I wouldn’t say most people.
I’d say his supporters.
They certainly think substantially less than normal people. 🤣
U can’t ALWAYS twist the story to make it look like trump has brain cells.
Stick to your day job and stay out of politics.
Stick to your day job and stay out of politics.
There is absolutely no way you are actually THAT dumb
Absolute CLOWN of a „human being“ (<- that part is a stretch)
BRAND NEW SONG PREVIEW!!!!!!!
These look super sick dude!!!
how my year started vs how it’s going
I am proud of you!!!!
whoever forfeited that one match ruined my streak.
let’s go baby
Exactly the opposite of how it goes for me.
MAINGEAR are the GOATS
♥️♥️♥️
D’oh!
playing with friends usually
Actually !!!
Sometimes it do be like that
hahahah
one may argue I don't belong here https://t.co/HxN7dTLvKC
Miss u boys too ♥️
jake it’s not worth arguing with people who don’t believe in science.
It’s a waste of energy.
People believe what’s most convenient for them and WILL find some propaganda statistic, completely out of context & backwards, to back them up.
faith vs facts. it’s one or the other.
Oh no you can :)
Just right click on the track and “save instrument track”. 
I have them all saved from all songs so when I want the lead from “clarity” e.g. I just load it and it loads the VST, all plugins used, EQ Settings etc so it brings it back exactly how u had it prior
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
U can save entire “instrument tracks” (VST synth + all effects / EQs”).
I LOOOOOVE it man.
The devs are also amazing and genuinely listen to feedback and implement a lot of the ideas people request.
Support is fantastic. Software is very stable.
Lots of functionalities other daws don’t have.
Basically built in “melodyne” into every track etc etc etc
Cubase is BY FAR the best DAW imo. U can do anything with it.
It’s insanely precise and detailed. 
Ha… 
Here’s how
Yessir, in cubase you can do that very easily.
here is the full frame.
Let’s not talk about how unorganized my shoes are but HAPPY NATIONAL SNEAKER DAY
♥️
Hahaha that’s actually incredible
Let me know how it is / if it’s worth the upgrade 240
Wait whaaaat these are out already????
You’re the only Legday I approve.
This is NUTS!
Leg day SUCKS
Ableton. No need to swap over if you’re comfortable.
What do you mean?
I thought he feels the best he’s felt in 20 years

Can we pls reduce the killjoy turret health to 50hp 🥺?
*Thick Fil A
I still don’t push people.
Yes.
Actually just talked to Joe a few days ago about it :)
APPLE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!
well isn’t this ironic...
Wtf
Good morning sunshine
Come pet them anytime u wish
Good morning 🐣
I think at 11pm pst today the patch is supposed to ship.
Today on stream we were able to have a calm conversation about politics while respecting each other’s different view points. 
It’s what we all need the most right now.
Compassion and our best attempt at understanding each other. 
The solution is usually somewhere in the middle.
Anytime

CLICK BELOW TO SEE ME LOSE EVERY GAME IN @PlayVALORANT !
Not everything is “Fake news”.
Only the things trump doesn’t like are.
The things that make him look bad, the things he fucked up, the things he lied about... just those are “fake news”.
Any inconvenient truth about him is “fake news” ;)
LEEEET’S GOOOO!!!!!!!
Time to raise some money for charity!!!! ♥️♥️♥️
