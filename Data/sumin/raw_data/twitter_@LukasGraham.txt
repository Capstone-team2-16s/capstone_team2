Humbly looking at my values and actions to check my own ego and ambition.
A lot of people will never allow you to grow, simply because they’re not growing as much or as fast as you.
See, the problem isn’t you growing or them not growing, but the fact that you may outgrow them.
It’s tricky, I know, but it’s not your problem. It’s their problem.
Typo alert😭😅☠️☠️

Only the supposedly clever ones learn nothing because they are so sure of their own intelligence and superiority
You know what? I am a fool.
And proud to be one so that I can learn a little more.

I'm overjoyed with how many fan submissions we got for this video. 
Even though the world may feel dark sometimes, there is still much love to be shared.
Share this video with a friend who may need to see it today! https://LukasGraham.lnk.to/STLFanVideo
Thanks
We went back to basics on this one.
Back home where i grew up.
Love looks like a lot of things and isn't always romantic, shots from Copenhagen to LA.

And your opinion matters.
Thanks for your very well written words
Can we have a chat?
Great.
So I’ve been writing &amp; collecting songs for an album, and I LOVE the songs that are competing to be on it.
BUT, I have people telling me not to think about an album, because people only listen to singles & selected/highlighted tracks now.
So I’m being told to make an album of only singles, no “album tracks”.
Had I done so before songs like “Funeral” “Hold My Hand” (finish the list yourself) would have never made it on an album. And that kind of thinking concerns me.
Because I believe in listening to an album from start to finish, with highs & lows, as an experience. And I’m honestly a little lost atm.
I just like writing & singing songs.
So, what is your take on all this?
Allow me a bit of time to answer please.
Thanks❤
I’m sure there’s plenty of folks here to chat with❤️
I know how you feel honey😅
Don’t miss my performance tonight on Vogue Spain’s Fashion Night In
Try @Iceman_Hof breath work for better diaphragm control.
Practice makes perfect and singing comes down to how you inhale/exhale and of course a little bit of genetics.
Don’t ask to be invited by people who don’t want you close.
Hold on to your dignity and let them go.
