Facts brother💔
The new remix of "Share That Love" by @R3HAB is out now.
Thanks brother, for speeding it up and making it a party starter 🔥🔥🔥
It's hard to fathom that it's been 5 years since "7 Years" was released worldwide😅
I can't thank you all enough for listening to the words that I write & the music we create🎶
Being able to keep doing what we do best is a blessing🙏 #Noaudiencenoshow 💛💙💜
And 💚Coming 2021💚
People are dying so that I can tweet from this phone... and so you can see this tweet on yours... 
I’m practicing my ability to listen.
And Denmark is supposedly a country without corruption🙄🤦‍♂️☠️
2021
Is someone going to the pre premiere?😜
2021
2021 international release
I am prepared to let everyone and everything go as I get to know myself.
What is meant to stay will stay. What is meant to go must go. I trust the process.
I’m getting pretty excited for November 5th🔥🔥🔥
Some yes. So I avoid them.
Not one of the arguments as far as I can see.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
So the Danish conservatives are advocating against plant based meat substitutes/options🙄 
I can’t figure out why...
I’m not a fan of those products personally, but I honestly don’t understand their arguments against them 😆
😭😭😭
I’ll be damned if I do it
Damn damned if I don’t...
Damn. I’m both😅
😂🤣
I took home both of our jumpers by mistake instead of swapping... so I guess I straight up stole it😅
I owe you the blur/grey one!!!
Warm autumn days ahead. Stole this jumper from legend @Teitur 🍂🇫🇴
Dope songwriters in town alert
🔥🔥🔥
You obviously hate mornings, we get it😂😂😂 
😅😅😅
Yes sir. I love both!
I love mornings.
Do you love mornings?
Being nobody is my escape.
Freedom from being somebody.
This dude is a machine💪
Empathy. A real productivity booster.
Working on it😅
Humbly looking at my values and actions to check my own ego and ambition.
A lot of people will never allow you to grow, simply because they’re not growing as much or as fast as you.
See, the problem isn’t you growing or them not growing, but the fact that you may outgrow them.
It’s tricky, I know, but it’s not your problem. It’s their problem.
Typo alert😭😅☠️☠️
Album coming 2021
Next single coming November 5th
Sorryyyyyyyyy
Thank you!😅
I forgot this one😂😂😂
Album coming 2020💚💚💚
Be inspired by me, but please don’t idolize me as a role model☠️

Life doesn’t always make sense and that’s the point🌸

Only the supposedly clever ones learn nothing because they are so sure of their own intelligence and superiority
You know what? I am a fool.
And proud to be one so that I can learn a little more.

I'm overjoyed with how many fan submissions we got for this video. 
Even though the world may feel dark sometimes, there is still much love to be shared.
Share this video with a friend who may need to see it today! https://LukasGraham.lnk.to/STLFanVideo
Thanks
We went back to basics on this one.
Back home where i grew up.
Love looks like a lot of things and isn't always romantic, shots from Copenhagen to LA.

Thank you
SHARE THAT LOVE!
Official video out tomorrow
And your opinion matters.
Thanks for your very well written words
Can we have a chat?
Great.
So I’ve been writing &amp; collecting songs for an album, and I LOVE the songs that are competing to be on it.
BUT, I have people telling me not to think about an album, because people only listen to singles & selected/highlighted tracks now.
So I’m being told to make an album of only singles, no “album tracks”.
Had I done so before songs like “Funeral” “Hold My Hand” (finish the list yourself) would have never made it on an album. And that kind of thinking concerns me.
Because I believe in listening to an album from start to finish, with highs & lows, as an experience. And I’m honestly a little lost atm.
I just like writing & singing songs.
So, what is your take on all this?
Allow me a bit of time to answer please.
Thanks❤
I’m sure there’s plenty of folks here to chat with❤️
I know how you feel honey😅
Don’t miss my performance tonight on Vogue Spain’s Fashion Night In
Try @Iceman_Hof breath work for better diaphragm control.
Practice makes perfect and singing comes down to how you inhale/exhale and of course a little bit of genetics.
Don’t ask to be invited by people who don’t want you close.
Hold on to your dignity and let them go.
