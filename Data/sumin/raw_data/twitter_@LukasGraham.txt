Jokes are not always meant to make sense you know😂
Happy birthday Alwx❤️🔥🎶 
got a smash coming out soon with these lovely gentlemen @cashcash aaaand @wizkhalifa
So stay tuned for more new music 🎵
Ok, sounds kinda like the hobbit movies that should have been one
Oh no.
I considered giving it a go since it looks like the 2nd season of the Witcher isn’t coming this year
One of my goals in songwriting is to write a song that can be performed with just one or two instruments or none at all.
It allows for stronger storytelling and better melodic choices when there is less to lean against.
The acoustic version of "STL" is out now.
I hope you like it
Did you get, or are you getting the new PS5 for/before Christmas?
Consider passing you old one on to someone or donate it to a gifting charity. 
A lot of folks can’t afford presents and there’s no need to let perfectly good things go to waste.
With all this fuss going around over @Harry_Styles i might start wearing dresses too.
@IggyPop said it best "I’m not ashamed to dress ‘like a woman’ because I don’t think it’s shameful to be a woman" - Iggy
Two girls. Three and a half years apart❤️ 
There is a piano ballad version available for streaming I believe...
🙌🙌🙌❤️ thanks
Sorry
Who else needs an after picture?😂
That sounds fun!
I mostly follow people I have a relation to irl
Happy to hear you’re good❤️
So EMO yet so tender😂 
Thank you🙏
I’m enjoying the little things in life.
Hi are you?
I need to start letting this mans books read me for sure 
ASAP
I write songs for me.
I release them for you.
Yesterday one of my oldest friends was buried.
Another legend lost.
You’re gone but not forgotten Emilio.
I remember teaching you English swear words in kindergarten ❤
Prince on my sound system this evening 👑
Terrifying😭
Ask @Lauren_Alaina cause we shot it already🔥🔥🔥🔥
Doing this broke my heart and gave me strength to carry on at the same time😭
@musiciansoncall is such an amazing charity ❤🎶
Almost cried, but I kept it all together for my new hero화재
What do you guys think of this song?
Your opinions are always interesting to me.
Since I write songs for me but I release them for you 💚
🙌🙌🙌
2021 🙏🔥🎶
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Being part of @musiciansoncall was special & unique in so many ways.
I'm still amazed when I hear what my songs mean to others and it motivates me to keep up my writing 💚
Helping people put words to how they feel is a special gift.
Thank you
2021🙏🔥🎶
Give him my best
Some days are just better than others
Sauna + ocean = serenity 
Do you want to get behind the scenes of my life the past 10 years?
This is it🔥🎶💚 and you can watch it in cinemas all over Denmark🇩🇰
Again where did you get this information?
Shit.
I don’t even trust my own creative process so how could I ever trust my closest friends and family.
I trust my instinct, my gut feeling, my heart.
The rush of Adrenalin when I write and or record something that makes me feel something.
When my blood pumps.
The moral of the story is: you can’t trust your friends and family because they want to protect you.
And you can’t trust people like me, because we don’t know you.
With luck: you have a few co-creators with whom to share ideas and feedback.
So trust and doubt yourself religiously
LITERALLY: Some of the people I trusted enough to play the demos of 7 years, love someone, happy home, not a damn thing changed, funeral etc.
thought the songs were not good enough to release even just as album songs.
To all the people trying to break through as singers/songwriters.
Stop asking for validation/feedback from people like me.
Honestly, my opinion matters as little as the next person.
Your heart knows when your stuff is good.
Be you, practice, work hard, rehearse. That’s it.
Today was a great day
No compliment😅
It’ll be on my next album in a different version😇
Stop the freemium model altogether.
🔥🎶💚🎶🔥
🙏🙏🙏💚
I never thought about it like that.
One of the reasons I never swear in my songs is I want my grandmother to not die when she hears em 😭
I’m also pro peace n ❤️ but the strife caused by the rhetoric is immensely huge.
😂😂❤️
No.
We’ve known each other my whole life and will most likely discuss this when we meet.
The whole idea of saying “the crazy rhetoric aside” is absolutely ludicrous.
Look at what the rhetoric creates... 🤯
😭😭😭
Is it available yet 🤞🙏
Where I’m from feat @wizkhalifa is out niw😍 been looking forward to this epic colab with @mustard and my boys Stefano, Rissi & @hennedub
🔥🎶🔥🎶🔥🎶🔥🎶🔥🎶
I’m see you there🙏
Hopefully😍🎶
Where did you get that information?
No.
Bro, you need to get out of whatever bubble you have been creating.
Please.
You used to make sense and now it’s more like nonsense.
I was only referring to Trump calling voter fraud.
I’m aware that you have a completely different voting system compared to us in Denmark.
It’s sad that you have no trust in your countries democratic process😔 the same process that got your current president elected.
Yes 💚💚💚 all the way
Big features and ballads coming up!
Uplifting songs and strsight🔥🔥
What just happened in the US of A?🤯
Because... Albums🎶
😂😅😇 have a great day💚
🙏🙏🙏
Where you grew up and where you're from will always have a big part to play in terms of where you end up.
It's all about making the best of it regardless of the adversity you face.
“Where I’m From” will be available on all music services on Thursday, Nov. 5th 🧡
2021🙏🔥🎶
Dive deeper into my story

Even at the house😷 jokes aside.
Wear a mask.
2021🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🍂
Yes sis.
It’s absolute 🔥 innit?
Another day on the subway like😷

Just for the record: “Abortion is not a debate. It’s a human right”
❤️
Germany is shutting down again.
Danes🇩🇰 please keep social distancing, use your masks and wash/sanitize your hands🙏
Together we can donthis❤😷🔥
And making a very valid point or not?
#ShareThatLove #RT
My dad used to book these guys in Scandinavia and they’re still some of the most inspirational musicians I can call friends of mine: @_themammals 🔥🎶❤
Facts brother💔
The new remix of "Share That Love" by @R3HAB is out now.
Thanks brother, for speeding it up and making it a party starter 🔥🔥🔥
It's hard to fathom that it's been 5 years since "7 Years" was released worldwide😅
I can't thank you all enough for listening to the words that I write & the music we create🎶
Being able to keep doing what we do best is a blessing🙏 #Noaudiencenoshow 💛💙💜
And 💚Coming 2021💚
People are dying so that I can tweet from this phone... and so you can see this tweet on yours... 
I’m practicing my ability to listen.
And Denmark is supposedly a country without corruption🙄🤦‍♂️☠️
2021
Is someone going to the pre premiere?😜
2021
2021 international release
I am prepared to let everyone and everything go as I get to know myself.
What is meant to stay will stay. What is meant to go must go. I trust the process.
I’m getting pretty excited for November 5th🔥🔥🔥
Some yes. So I avoid them.
Not one of the arguments as far as I can see.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
So the Danish conservatives are advocating against plant based meat substitutes/options🙄 
I can’t figure out why...
I’m not a fan of those products personally, but I honestly don’t understand their arguments against them 😆
😭😭😭
I’ll be damned if I do it
Damn damned if I don’t...
Damn. I’m both😅
😂🤣
I took home both of our jumpers by mistake instead of swapping... so I guess I straight up stole it😅
I owe you the blur/grey one!!!
Warm autumn days ahead. Stole this jumper from legend @Teitur 🍂🇫🇴
Dope songwriters in town alert
🔥🔥🔥
You obviously hate mornings, we get it😂😂😂 
😅😅😅
Yes sir. I love both!
I love mornings.
Do you love mornings?
Being nobody is my escape.
Freedom from being somebody.
This dude is a machine💪
Empathy. A real productivity booster.
Working on it😅
Humbly looking at my values and actions to check my own ego and ambition.
A lot of people will never allow you to grow, simply because they’re not growing as much or as fast as you.
See, the problem isn’t you growing or them not growing, but the fact that you may outgrow them.
It’s tricky, I know, but it’s not your problem. It’s their problem.
Typo alert😭😅☠️☠️
Album coming 2021
Next single coming November 5th
Sorryyyyyyyyy
Thank you!😅
I forgot this one😂😂😂
Album coming 2020💚💚💚
Be inspired by me, but please don’t idolize me as a role model☠️
You want to do what you do🔥
Copying is easier than being your true self🎶
Life doesn’t always make sense and that’s the point🌸
Thank you☀

Only the supposedly clever ones learn nothing because they are so sure of their own intelligence and superiority
You know what? I am a fool.
And proud to be one so that I can learn a little more.
And so are you❤️

I'm overjoyed with how many fan submissions we got for this video. 
Even though the world may feel dark sometimes, there is still much love to be shared.
Share this video with a friend who may need to see it today! https://LukasGraham.lnk.to/STLFanVideo
Thanks
We went back to basics on this one.
Back home where i grew up.
Love looks like a lot of things and isn't always romantic, shots from Copenhagen to LA.

Full album it is.

That’s what I’m talking about
Thank you
SHARE THAT LOVE!
Official video out tomorrow
And your opinion matters.
Thanks for your very well written words
Can we have a chat?
Great.
So I’ve been writing &amp; collecting songs for an album, and I LOVE the songs that are competing to be on it.
BUT, I have people telling me not to think about an album, because people only listen to singles & selected/highlighted tracks now.
So I’m being told to make an album of only singles, no “album tracks”.
Had I done so before songs like “Funeral” “Hold My Hand” (finish the list yourself) would have never made it on an album. And that kind of thinking concerns me.
Because I believe in listening to an album from start to finish, with highs & lows, as an experience. And I’m honestly a little lost atm.
I just like writing & singing songs.
So, what is your take on all this?
Allow me a bit of time to answer please.
Thanks❤
I’m sure there’s plenty of folks here to chat with❤️
I know how you feel honey😅
Don’t miss my performance tonight on Vogue Spain’s Fashion Night In
Try @Iceman_Hof breath work for better diaphragm control.
Practice makes perfect and singing comes down to how you inhale/exhale and of course a little bit of genetics.
Don’t ask to be invited by people who don’t want you close.
Hold on to your dignity and let them go.
