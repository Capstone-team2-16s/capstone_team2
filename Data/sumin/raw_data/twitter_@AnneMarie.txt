Life is too short to live through other people’s eyes.
You will NEVER know what people are really thinking.
So what’s the point in wondering/worrying in the first place?? & WHO CARES??
Your life is yours. And YOURS ONLY. You beautiful soul.
Care less and love your life more. 🤍
You are entirely up to you.
???? Is there a cure ? Let me know

I didn’t know ham burgers didn’t have a slice of ham in there.
They really are elite
I feel bad that I’ve never appreciated sheer black tights enough.
ALEXA, play PROBLEMS by Anne-Marie!!!!! 🙌 
I feel this.
Im also insensitive to natural light so it doesn’t wake me up.
I’ve tried everything.
And I have ADD, I’m hyper aware and dyslexia which really does not help my sleep.
Am I alone in this? Lol
Btw this is real.
My body clock is 26 hours. It’s a thing.
Read about it.
It sucks to try and live on a 24 hour one.
Can we all just get over the whole waking up early thing?! I can’t do it, I’ve tried my whole life do it and never have been/will be able to.
My body clock is just different and I’m sick of trying to adjust to whoever made 24 hours the rule.
OH MYYYY GODDDD YESSSSSSS

The beauty of talking and letting things out never fails us.
The sun is shining as we are locked in again.
Keep your mind active, get some fresh air and do a cartwheel.

I only just found out mince pie hasn’t got minced meat in it.
Well I love soft matte lip cream called los Angeles 😍

A local barber in my neighbourhood was arrested for selling drugs. 
Unbelievable.
I’d been his customer for years and had no idea he was a barber.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I got fired from my job at the bank today.
An old lady asked me to check her balance - so I pushed her over.
Want more jokes ?
I asked my wife if I was the only one she’d been with. 
She said yes, all the others had been nines and tens.
Next joke in 10 minutes
The man who invented Velcro died.
RIP
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE WOMAN!
I went to a psychic and knocked on her front door. 
She yelled “who is it?”. 
So I left.
Working out is like a drug to me.
I don’t do drugs.
YEAAHAHHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
My boss hates it when I shorten his name to Dick. 
Especially when his name is Steve.
You’ll have another one in half hour I gotta spread this out!!!
I met a girl the other night at a club who said she’d show me a good time.....
When we got outside, she ran a 40 metre dash in just 4.5 seconds.
Just got a new joke book
Here we go
Today I’m gonna be writing a lot of jokes for you
Your life isn’t yours if you constantly care what others think.
