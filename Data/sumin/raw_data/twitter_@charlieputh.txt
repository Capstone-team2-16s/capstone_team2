Hahahaha wait is this real because it’s amazing I’m laughing
I’m a country artist now.
Thank you for having me @GabbyBarrett_
Do you ever read a text message in the voice of the person who sent it to you?
I always insert a little bit of reverb echo on each voice.
Good morning!!!!
That feels good
My heart is heavy hearing of Alex Trebek’s passing.
The soundtrack of my life was hearing his voice every night at 7pm.
There will never be a host quite like him ever again.
God bless him and his family.
And may his legacy forever live on.
(Insert final Jeopardy music here.)
Music is about to get very VERY good.
Listen to the Star-Spangled Banner sung by Whitney Houston at the 1991 Super Bowl right now. ♥️ 🇺🇸
Thinking about becoming a singer.
I want to produce a metal record.

Hahahahahaha
Let me know if you need an unnecessary jazz piano solo on any track.
The snare on Work It by @MissyElliott is still one of my favorite snares used in a song.
Timbo layered some crackle noise on top of it and it gave it so much character.
A little noise goes a long way. 🤓
Just listened to Attention for the first time in a year. Song bangs
IF THEY DON’T SEE IT IN YOU THEN THATS ON THEM!!

Protect all friends with good snacks in their house.
Red light special
Offset has a great singing voice.
I only called her one time.....
Absolutely incredible
I’m really good at confessing things I don’t wanna know about myself in my songs.
Girrrrlll your energy.....feels so heavenly......
Lately I’ve been thinking about if you’re worth it, or do I just stay and play the game.
Because 99% of the time I’m hurting, but the other 1 makes it go away.
Love you.
Praise Nicki
If it doesn’t sound right in my head from the beginning....it’s never gonna sound good in the end.
No one tops Eminem’s internal rhyming flow to this day.

Before the song is even recorded, I like to picture a crowd singing along with the song.
That’s how I know people will be able to sing along to it.
Listen to something you wouldn’t normally listen to.
I turned on French music the other day.
The most important thing to me when I make a melody is tension and release.
A hit chorus usually has a melody that is evident in its resolution.
Ask me a music question.
Or anything
Bagels!!!!!
I like the pain
You ever just wanna pour a pumpkin spice latte all over your body?
