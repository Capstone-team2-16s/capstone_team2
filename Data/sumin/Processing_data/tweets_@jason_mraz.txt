Doug Jones showing how it’s done!
I loved working with producer Michael Goldwasser on my new album, Look For The Good.
As a lifelong lover of reggae music, it was incredible to team up with him & Sister Carol.

Still looking for the good? I found it in the @goodtidingsSF who are up to good things transforming spaces to be more accessible, more inclusive, and more fun.
Not only did they create the Mraz Music Studio at @AReason2Survive
, we recorded a podcast there!
Good times had on this song Steve.
Thanks for all the awkward 2020 moments.
The power of now.
