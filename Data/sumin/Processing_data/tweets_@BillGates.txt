I’m excited to see this kind of innovation.
Detecting and predicting outbreaks earlier is critical to preventing epidemics.
The only way to eliminate the threat of COVID-19 somewhere is to eliminate it everywhere.
By making sure poor countries are equipped to stop this disease, wealthy countries will help themselves and bring this crisis to an end sooner.
Understanding this concept can help us measure our progress toward eliminating carbon emissions and serve as a guide to action.
Developing and manufacturing vaccines won’t end the pandemic quickly unless we also deliver them equitably.
Here is why it’s critical that vaccines are distributed in proportion to the global population: LINK 
Great to see the UK commit vital funding to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available for the world’s poorest people.
PM @BorisJohnson's plan will improve the way we prepare for future crises like this. 
After 20 years of stunning advances toward global goals to improve health and reduce poverty, the COVID-19 pandemic stopped progress in its tracks.
In our foundation’s Goalkeepers report, we survey the damage and discuss how to start reversing it.
To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need innovation across all sectors—especially in the hardest to decarbonize sectors—to get us on a viable path to net-zero emissions. 
Dr. John Nkengasong is a true Goalkeeper.
His leadership will help ensure Africa has the tools it needs to fight COVID-19: LINK
