We went back to basics on this one.
Back home where i grew up.
Love looks like a lot of things and isn't always romantic, shots from Copenhagen to LA.

And your opinion matters.
Thanks for your very well written words
Can we have a chat?
Great.
So I’ve been writing &amp; collecting songs for an album, and I LOVE the songs that are competing to be on it.
BUT, I have people telling me not to think about an album, because people only listen to singles & selected/highlighted tracks now.
So I’m being told to make an album of only singles, no “album tracks”.
Had I done so before songs like “Funeral” “Hold My Hand” (finish the list yourself) would have never made it on an album. And that kind of thinking concerns me.
Because I believe in listening to an album from start to finish, with highs & lows, as an experience. And I’m honestly a little lost atm.
I just like writing & singing songs.
So, what is your take on all this?
Allow me a bit of time to answer please.
Thanks❤
I’m sure there’s plenty of folks here to chat with❤️
I know how you feel honey😅
Don’t miss my performance tonight on Vogue Spain’s Fashion Night In
Try @Iceman_Hof breath work for better diaphragm control.
Practice makes perfect and singing comes down to how you inhale/exhale and of course a little bit of genetics.
Don’t ask to be invited by people who don’t want you close.
Hold on to your dignity and let them go.
