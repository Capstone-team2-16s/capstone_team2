Singalong with me during the #DisneyHolidaySingalong Monday Nov 30 at 8|7c on ABC
What a momentous day!!!!!
Yeah Donny, but not enough.
This news has brought me to tears.
I was overwhelmed with relief for this country.
I was overwhelmed for Kamala and the inspiration that she brings to girls everywhere.
Van Jones made me cry ugly tears.
This country has so much work to do to come together.
I pray we can do it. ❤
Hahahaha NOPE
That’s right, we did our part.
#EveryVoteCounts & it’s time to wait for democracy to deliver.
We're in this together.

I thought that @CNN did a wonderful job today with their piece explaining why they cover the corona virus.
They showed empathy and respect for the experience of the American people.
Something Donald Trump has failed at repeatedly.
Well done @CNN
Man, Larry doesn’t mess around. Good.
And these efforts have already raised an impressive $150K, but I think we can do even better.

You’re welcome little man
And I will say this as well, I have had an incredible time traveling this world, and I have felt very lucky to visit other countries, including Russia.
I am sick of the divide in this world because our leaders fail us.
All over the world.
The way forward is NOT WHAT WE’RE DOING.
We are all one people.
Even though the racist in charge has confused things because he himself is confused, we are ALL better than this.
Even Trump supporters know this.
We are ALL BETTER THAN THIS
America,
Are you okay with this dipshit? Seriously?
I’m so ashamed that we’ve lowered ourselves to even consider another term for this shameful loser.
Even if you think  it’s still defendable behavior.
Your children are watching
Vote this racist, childish, ignorant, tax evading, DRAFT DODGING CLOWN OUT OF OFFICE.
Oh i did Honey cakes.
My vote goes to JOE BIDEN because I don’t believe in racists and liars. 🖕🏽
My vote goes to an adult with experience that acts as well or better than I expect my children to behave. JOE BIDEN
I am so here for this
I feel like the moderators of our debates now need to be preschool teachers in order to deal with the sulking clown that is Donald.
There’s no debate: If we #TurnTexasBlue, Trump is through.
$38 for 38 electoral votes.
While I do enjoy a healthy dose of MANSPLAINING, I think I’ll skip the tutorial there, Buzz.
You should change the channel occasionally.
Have a great day! 
Just watched UNFIT for the second time in four days.
I challenge every single person that can vote, regardless of party or who you’re planning to vote for, to watch this... and talk amongst yourselves.
Dissent is the cornerstone of democracy.
Is it not?
Ironic post: to anyone reading this: please watch THE SOCIAL DILEMMA. As soon as possible.
This is not a political post. It’s a human one.
Thanks 😊
Yeah! Exactly what he said!
