#RememberWhoSaidNothing
Some of the Charlie Kirk jokes happening right now are just so so so good.
Iâ€™m dying.
This was great
This got me excited for Christmas.
Itâ€™s also truly amazing.
Itâ€™s over. You lost.
If you donâ€™t like it, take it all the way to the Supreme Courtyard Marriott.
Top-shelf joke writing.
I already started writing our Parent Trap remake.
Beautiful palate cleanser.
Magic everywhere.
Donâ€™t forget about the calming power of awe.
Try not to label or analyze.
Just be with it, in awe.
No you didnâ€™t.
You lost.
Mark â€˜Not Controlling the Pandemicâ€™ Meadows AND Matt â€˜Gas Maskâ€™ Gaetz both test positive for Covid????
Wow. Just wow. The timing is stunning. 
Also, when I typed in â€˜gaetzâ€™, I swear on everything, my autocorrect changed it to â€˜fartsâ€™.

Friendly reminder that @ASP has a lot of helpful information :)
This is a man who served his country over his ego.
He praised our treasured institutions over his own party.
He was an example of leadership even in defeat.
He tried to bring us together while accepting his toughest political loss because he knew what truly made us great.
WATCH!
Damn. I love @StephenAtHome 
Thank you for this. 
Every single Republican needs to watch this. https://t.co/305KjB7t1O
Wow.
Hey Republicans, are you listening to this come-to-life toilet spew complete lies about the integrity of our democratic process?
Love this guy
This actual meatball wants to fire the U.S.â€™s top infectious disease expert during a pandemic.
Fauci is a man of science.
Other folks from the scientific community need to stand up for Fauci before this dunce cap replaces him with Lil Wayne.
Happy Halloween!!
(He hated every second of it)
ALWAYS a pleasure!

Thereâ€™s a slight chance that I might have the best dog in the world.
And he doesnâ€™t even know it.
Itâ€™s such a clean dynamic.
What did we do to deserve dogs?
Hearing Larry David yell is one of my favorite things â€“ especially when heâ€™s right.

Donâ€™t be afraid of Covid?!
Youâ€™ve been under round-the-clock care by the best doctors using the best drugs.
Do you really think everyone has access to that?!
Sadly, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re aware of that disparity, you just donâ€™t care
This is reckless to a shocking degree, even for you
I can explain....
My blood is boiling.
