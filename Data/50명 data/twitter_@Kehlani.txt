Beautiful 🤍 
which one of us is getting the other a citizenship and where
hi 😘
see attached tweet, totally agree ☺️
i didn’t mean “love n light stones n stars” as a shame to light workers, crystal workers & astrologers i saw that saying one day as an explanation of avoiding the shadow work / hard work and it stuck with me. 😂
we all start somewhere
the realer the healing work..
the realer the commitment
the quieter it’s kept.
i  did a lot more talking when i was doing the faux-work. the love n light stones n stars. 
let people perceive whatever they want from your silence. the silence is for you.
me too 😭
this was a sweet read.
supporting you, you can do it!! 🤍✨
i actually say “it’s a saturday, Shabba in LA”
😭
