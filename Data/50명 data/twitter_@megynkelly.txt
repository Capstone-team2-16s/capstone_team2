This. Was. Hysterical. 
And a great conversation all around with @RubinReport. Still laughing. 
Why is this up to ⁦@JaniceDean⁩? 
Where is the media?

Proud to be an American. 
Went to see this beauty this morning. 
She’s spectacular. And worth fighting for. 
Literally - omg 
It’s amazing! 
@DougBrunt has mixology talents! 
Here are the ingredients - equal parts tequila (jalapeño infused)/mezcal, a lot of fresh lime juice (he used one and a half limes for 2 drinks) and a dash of simple syrup. 
Happy Friday people.
@DougBrunt is trying to replicate a new (to me) tequila drink w/mezcal etc. that I recently had in a restaurant.
Me: “don’t worry, I have very low expectations and I know you’re going to exceed them.”
Him: “That doesn’t make any sense.”
This is why I married him.
Best actor?
In which @JamesCarville has a few words of warning for “The Squad.”
A really fun and in-depth interview about my new podcast @MegynKellyShow ... and life ... with @StevenEdginton &amp; yes, @piersmorgan, you will like this clip.
A great conversation and some good info on the Georgia Senate races. 
Thank you Governor! 
This was fun - @JoeTalkShow is a great interviewer! 
The guy infamous for mocking Trump voters as stupid losers who can’t read (on CNN) now says he *really* tried to reach out but just “cannot help ppl who refuse to help themselves...”-namely his “oppressors.” 
He warns: “don’t waste your time.” 
But, UNITY!
As usual @JoeConchaTV nails it: 
the Qs at Biden’s presser the other day “included questions that can't even be called softball, but more like T-ball when putting a beach ball on the tee.” 
Get used to it, he (accurately) warns.
There are many powerful, strong, smart women out there ... but there’s only one @Ayaan. 
Honored to know her. Enjoy...
Look at his indignation! 
At the suggestion that NYC schools might close on Thu. 
“You’re confused,” he says smugly. 
Right before NYC announces: 
School’s are closing on Thu. Gross.
Love this @MelissaAFrancis! 
To you, me, our guys and Elio’s and the many fun times to come. 💕💕💕
So sick of the sanctimonious lectures these folks give the plebes while they do whatever the hell they want. 
Remember when Newsom’s office advised ppl to WEAR THEIR MASKS B/TWN BITES while eating out??
“Disgraceful” Andrew Cuomo  says he’s “not going to allow New Yorkers to be bullied or abused.” 
NY Post w/the perfect response: “Only he gets to do that.”
I promised to transcribe what Prof. 
@GlennLoury said on the pod today &amp; here it is (though hearing it from him directly was so powerful). 
V. grateful we have people like Glenn who can articulate what we know in our hearts in such a compelling, stand-and-cheer kind of way.
THIS ⬇️. Free speech is not negotiable. https://t.co/zpbg7EEmw3
You really, really don’t want to miss this pod. 
Trust me.
Prof. @GlennLoury⁩: “Are u going to look [at] the U.S. as a racist, genocidal, white supremacist, illegitimate force? 
Or are u going to see it for what it is? 
Which is...the greatest force for human liberty on the planet? 
That’s worth fighting about!”
@JaniceDean mentioned on my podcast that she wished someone would do a clip showing how Gov. Cuomo blames everyone but himself for NY’s nursing home deaths (after *he* gave the order for Covid+ patients to be accepted in the homes). JD! 
Check this out from @ReaganBattalion!
From the one &amp; only Coleman Hughes (@coldxman):
“You don’t have to teach patriotism. 
All you have to teach is balanced world history. 
And a rational person will come to the conclusion that there is something special about America.”
Happy Autumn, the greatest season of the year. 
Unity! Healing! 
Everywhere u get podcasts!
This one is personal, &amp; highlights my friend @JaniceDean’s crusade for truth when it comes to Covid &amp; Cuomo. 
Also what she said when once asked “so, how are you at phone sex?” 
(Her answer will make you lol.)
And you say you want “unity.” 
The madness. ;)
The great @mtaibbi - one of the most talented writers &amp; journalists in America - with a brutally honest, unsparing assessment of the media, the far Left wokesters, and the “dumbest book ever written” White Fragility. 
Enjoy!
od bless our veterans and the USA! 
Courage, sacrifice, dignity — thank you for setting an example to which we should all aspire. 
With gratitude...
Me: “So many things are controlled by the L: sports, publishing, the media,Hollywood. 
What do conservatives control?”.
@DennisPrager: “Ourselves. 
We don’t want to control other ppl. 
We want to be left alone to lead a life we think is important.” ⬇️ 
It really was a powerful emotional journey - gonna be thinking about it for a long time. 
Proud to know you @JaniceDean. 💕
Honestly, not ONE MORE DAMN LECTURE, AD, OR ABSURD MORAL PREENING from this absolutely depraved group or anyone who supports them - on anything, ever.
I recommend you not take her up on that Sir.
Omg
First @RichardGrenell gets erased and now @KellyannePolls? 
Classy. 
Breaking!!! 
Oh! Tough guy!! 
How about you do an interview w/⁦@JaniceDean⁩ to prove it? 
She’s so sweet - even wrote a book called “Mostly Sunny” - what’s there to fear?
@bpmehlman w/a great synopsis of why voters behaved as they did in all races (federal, state)... 
Biden had no coattails, narrowest mandate...
Trump seriously hurt by his handling of COVID.
Wherein the attempted fact-check on Tucker fails:
“The Fox host...darkly hinted that Democrats & the press were making enemies lists.” 
Kid, they literally are making enemy lists:
- https://washingtontimes.com/news/2020/nov/8/biden-backers-blacklist-trump-loyalists-trump-acco/
- https://twitter.com/jrubinblogger/status/1324792225260253184?s=21 https://mediaite.com/news/tucker-carlson-blasts-cnn-equates-jake-tapper-to-sicilian-mafia-for-urging-national-unity/
This is crazy. 
He helped Biden draft his speech on Sat night, without disclosing that fact to the audience (or anyone?), then reacted to the speech live on the air as a paid MSNBC contributor. 
Let me guess- he liked it?
No one is talking to you.
This is amazing! 
Congrats!
Can you imagine if we did this to Obama’s “If you like your plan you can keep your plan”??  
I am not in favor of cutting the WH press sec off or the prez off to prevent misleading. 
Fact check after the statement, yes. 
But it’s not our job to protect the viewers’ virgin ears.
Hi @jkbjournalist - think you meant to address that to @KirstenPowers. 
Have a great day!

Honey, you should unfollow! 
Free yourself babe.
This is perfect. 
In an attempt to support my claim that Biden’s pronouncement of “unity” & “healing” was not realistic, that we are too divided, this actor (shock: he hates Republicans) decides to mock the reasons Rs aren’t feeling so chummy. 
Thanks for making my point!
For those confused, Chris Cuomo retweeted that little acting tweet - wanted me to see it - and thankfully I did!
Omg @ChrisCuomo! 
I totally thought this was you doing more terrible acting like when you had COVID (while your brother was killing off 6k seniors) &, after exposing half ur neighborhood while not wearing your mask, did your fake emergence from the basement! But this guy is better
You’re making my initial point of the day, Sir. Tell it to Mr. Biden.
You have every right to your anger Ted. 
As do GOP voters who have been unfairly vilified by leaders on the L. 
And it won’t go away, in either case, bc a politician wins & tweets “Healed!” He needs to start at home. 
Talk to AOC & the media re: unity. 
Then some GOPers might listen.
You have every right to your anger Ted.

Hope you will subscribe- let’s talk.
Btw ⁦@mattwilstein⁩ - ur mag published this piece of shit article re: me when I wouldn’t defend R Ailes. 
So you can take a seat on “oh how we all used to rally for MK.” 
This piece was meant to shame other women from spkg up & DB ran w/it with glee.
Joan, I am trying to explain the mindset of the right half of the country, which I happen to understand, unlike most in the media. 
You may find it helpful, you may not. 
But the notion that I should make it all about me & Trump’s comments is absurd. 
I moved past it long ago.
I never needed your rallying. 
This isn’t about me. 
Tho I do know how you on the far Left (of whom rational liberals are embarrassed) love a person to play the victim.
No
Martina, the vitriol went well beyond Trump-some 70m ppl have been called vile, bigots, racists & xenophobes & are now being threatened w/being put on target “lists” as punishment for supporting him. 
They’ve been demonized by the very ppl now sanctimoniously demanding “civility.”
See? 
If you are a voter ticked off about being called a racist, xenophobic, sexist bigot for the past four years it is your “white fear” similar to after the Civil War. 
Good grief.
- Leftists/media re GOP: “racists! Xenophobes! Uncaring bigots!”
- Biden wins. “Unity!”
- Trump supporters: “Eh, not feeling it.”
- Leftists/media: “please be more responsible in your language.”
Not just him. 
Anyone who supported him. 
Oh no. Oh this is too sad. 
Thank you for entertaining us all these years, Alex. 
Rest In Peace. 
You can be as angry as you want. 
But let’s not pretend after 4 yrs of bare knuckled, brutal, and grossly vicious brawling, now that your guy is ascending to the WH, it’s all over and “unity,” “healing,” peace, love & understanding bc ... memory.
Not trying to fight you either Austan but be realistic- here is what is coming out of your party right now:
I would love nothing more. 
Might be tough with the reality on the ground: https://t.co/UO7r4MsUCY
Ian, you’re out of touch if you think 70m Americans who have been unfairly demonized as the worst of humanity for 4yrs are now going to hug those who’ve viciously attacked them (& are now making lists of their names). 
I’m talking reality, which is my job, not pie-in-the-sky stuff
Biden calls for “unity” and “healing” - perhaps he should take it up first with the loudest voices of his own party? 
No. Half of the country has been demonized as awful for four years just for supporting their president who was falsely accused of Russian collaboration, wrongly impeached & attacked relentlessly by the L & a dishonest media. 
And now it’s “let’s heal!” “Unity!” 
Good luck.
Awesome. 
I’m rooting for you in your journey!
I agree w/you that Biden doesn’t think that.
But a large faction of his supporters & media (but I repeat myself) do & have been peddling that vitriol for 4 yrs. 
I know ur happy he won, but to pretend this is now the “unity” era is to be willfully blind to reality.
You have zero understanding of the mood of 70 million Americans who have been unfairly attacked relentlessly for the past four years as awful ppl just for supporting their president.
Pathetic and once again more proof that you only know how to sling mud &amp; debase yourself.
It’s not about me. 
It’s about the country.
I’m call them like I see them, same as u. 
He is out of touch if he thinks his election means unity/hsed (& continue to) half the nation as evil for 4 yrs.ealing in a nation in which his supporters have dismis 
Top Ds are right now threatening anyone who “enabled” him. 
Go fix that.
No. Half of the country has been demonized as awful for four years just for supporting their president who was falsely accused of Russian collaboration, wrongly impeached & attacked relentlessly by the L & a dishonest media. 
And now it’s “let’s heal!” “Unity!” 
Good luck.
From anyone other than you, that might resonate.
You have zero understanding of the mood of 70 million Americans who have been unfairly attacked relentlessly for the past four years as awful ppl just for supporting their president.
Then it’s delusional & out of touch. 
Republicans have been told for 4 years that they’re racist, sexist, xenophobic bigots if they support Trump & now suddenly it’s “let’s heal! Unite!” 
It’s not going to happen. 
He should check Twitter to see what D’s are saying re “lists” etc.
It isn’t true. At all.
Written like a man who’s been in his basement for a year.
Prayers up 🙏🏻 - will light a candle too. 
God bless her.
I do when it comes to being not driven by politics or ideology, which most of the country is not.
Congrats to those feeling happy about Biden’s win. 
Empathy to those who are disappointed &amp; upset. 
All I know is we are lucky enough to live in the USA—greatest country on earth—& none of the unhinged reactions (D & R) to today’s news represent most of us.
It’s gonna be exactly the opposite.
What an awesome tweet for the Georgia GOP to plaster everywhere in their effort to ensure Republicans keep the Senate.
Omg me too -  HE IS HILARIOUS!
Yes! Anywhere you get podcasts. 
It’s free!
Pelosi says Biden has a “huge mandate.” 
Really? Dems lost seats when supposed to gain them in her chamber, d/n/gain control of Senate, saw DT win more votes than ever with minority groups, & did not see the promised Blue Wave. 
Truth will prevail in Jan. 
when gridlock settles in.
It’s on all platforms! Free!
I absolutely loved re-connecting. 
Thank you for doing it @scrowder!
Trump is right to make sure we had a fair election. 
To ensure there’s no widespread proof of voter fraud that could change the result. 
And then, when it becomes clear-as it now is-that it is over for him, he must do the gracious, patriotic, right thing: concede, & pass the torch.
Prepare to laugh, think, be offended (?) &amp; entertained w/the one &amp; only @scrowder. 
From the Fox call on AZ, to Big Tech cracking down on him, depression, sex, infertility...& some lol stories about my pal John Stossel - enjoy.
Fox calls WI for Biden. 
As to AZ, Fox Decision Desk has been bulletproof on calls for nearly 20 yrs. 
The call changes only if massive probs in AZ reporting (highly unlikely). 
That means no path for DT w/o PA & MI and MI starting to look out of reach. 
PA may wind up irrelevant.
Doh!
Wth??
“Uncle Clarence?” 
Are you kidding me?? 
I’m going to bed but my bleary thoughts as I drift off to sleep are: 
DT wins MI, loses WI and it all comes down to PA, which clearly needs a lesson from FL in how to count its votes faster!
My read on Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk)’s mssg:  
Trump struggling in WI. 
Going to win GA. Needs MI and PA. 
Could do it but won’t know for a while.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk):
Michigan: 
Trump is currently in the lead; did “extremely well” in Election Day voting, 
but still must count early & mail-in votes (which happens later). 
Final result will “be much closer.” 
Biden better here than in GA.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk) - Trump needs MT, GA, NC &amp; PA. 
He then needs also WI or MI.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk) - PA could easily take several days to count. 
Need everyone on Decision Desk to agree who has won; and then need to see how almost certain litigation shakes out.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk) says Biden has the advantage in Wisconsin.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk) - should be able to call Georgia soon - suggests it will likely go for Trump.
Arnon Mishkin (head of Fox News Decision Desk): 
Trump has an advantage in NC (w/94% reporting), we’re just not sure it’s a callable advantage yet.
Checking my math...
If DT holds PA but loses MI *and* WI, that’s 269, right?
Trump wins Texas
Trump wins Ohio per Fox News
Fox News calling the first flip of the night: 
Arizona for Biden. 
11 electoral votes.

Florida looking very good for Trump. 
Panhandle will be very red - that’s what we’re waiting on and Team Trump must be feeling a little relieved.
Four years ago we met with the Fox News Decision Desk guys at 5p (they’d seen the 1st wave of exit polls). 
These are straight shooters, not pundits. 
The headline was “it’s going to be a very good night for Hillary Clinton.” 
It’s anyone’s race, folks.
Looking forward to it! 
Thank you for this! 
I’ve had so much I’ve wanted to say. 
Feels good to call the balls &amp; strikes. 
JD, you’re the greatest! 
Can’t wait to have you on the show! 💕
No, she isn’t. And guess what? 
She’s on there for life.
My take on where we are... an awful media bent on destroying itself ... and why Trump voters have nothing to be ashamed of.
Personally I like the little details - really brought me there!
Today's show-@hughhewitt on the choice between security &amp; freedom, @AndrewYang on modernizing SCOTUS and why @JoeBiden is a "really nice wet blanket" & pollster @RobertCahaly on the increase he's seeing among the black vote for Trump
I think it’s more disaffected GOP women &amp; non-woke Dem women.
Maybe he’s thinking of those same suburban women we were just discussing
Sweet baby. She an angel!
Disagree. 
Many women see what’s being done to kids in far-Left schools (race &amp; gender shaming, “sex ed” that’s more like soft core porn, teaching the “100 genders” canard, openly saying parents’ rights end at school doors, etc) & come back to the GOP, whether pro Trump or not.
I was just going to vote for Heath!
Classic @scrowder⁩ ...and I love the hug at the end... 
Take it up w/Jimmy Fallon, Joy Behar, Jimmy Kimmel, Robert Downey Jr.,Ted Danson, Sarah Silverman, Justin Trudeau, Julianne Hough... 
I could go on but why bother? 
Ur dishonest click bait headline only chose me (who has never worn BF) so ppl might actually read your shitty pub.
Happens around this time every four years. 
Then folks calm down and are nicer.
Cool. Start by unfollowing me or you look a bit hypocritical. Ciao.
Look over here! Something shiny!
This made me &amp; @DougBrunt lol.
100% right.

He’s brilliant, thoughtful...& sets an example I aspire to follow. 
Thx for having me Coleman!

THREAD 
Exactly. It used to be we could celebrate a jurist’s ascension to the Supreme Court out of decency and love of country, no matter who appointed them. 
@girlscouts apparently wishes to change that in a surrender to the worst political bullies on the Left.
This is pathetic @girlscouts. 
It’s not “partisan” to generically congratulate the 5th woman ever to join the High Court. 
It’s patriotic. 
Taking your tweet down *is* partisan, however, and a real disappointment.
Can’t remember
My head hurts.
An AMAZING couple!! Love you guys!
The show is doing amazingly well - thanks to you! 
Come see what all the excitement is about...
He’s got all the signs of lying that Phil Houston highlights in his book “Spy the Lie:” 
(1) doesn’t just say “no”-he deflects w/“oh that old parlor game” & (2) *convincing* behavior-“I only wear a mask for 2 reasons...” 
Truth wld sound more clear & simple.
Miles Taylor should have stuck with his previous moniker. 
Now he bores me.
It is, so you shouldn’t.
You are gonna LOVE this interview w/ @piersmorgan on cancel culture, victim culture, what it’s like to get fired & smeared by the dishonest press ... & the benefits of—the occasional—spectacular failure.
I wonder if this will be a national story on every news channel for the next few days &amp; if @joerogan will be on the cover of the tabloids as “World’s Most Hated Dad”? 
I heard that happened once. 
Could be wrong.
Take a minute to see what these “protests” have become &amp; who they hurt - 9x out of 10 it’s hard working minority business owners. 
One of the many reasons why the support for BLM has plummeted.
Oh but Gerald, I’m not a conservative and never have been. 
Not a lib. 
Just a fair reporter. 
Try to understand: not everyone is agenda-driven.
Correct
Hello, this was sarcasm
For people who don’t understand sarcasm, umm, this is it. ⬇️ https://t.co/9OBPwNWJkb
Stop with all the facts and reason, @larryelder.
I know, I did it on my pod today and thought: 🤬
The fact that you don’t care to understand *why* these folks felt the need to loot is further evidence of said systemic racism.
I’m going to guess more intentionally dishonest than stupid, but either way, @sunny is embarrassingly wrong about the Supreme Court. 
As usual. (Remember: this is a woman still clinging to the “hands up don’t shoot” lie.) 
Good for @bariweiss
I will call her whatever I damn well please, and ACB sounds perfect. 
In an attempt to be the anti-Trump, they removed all the people, danger ... and fun.
I’m a proud supporter of military members. 
They defend us.
Now we must protect them.

I’ve been making this point on my podcast: the RCP avg of polls in virtually every swing state shows Biden up over Trump by a margin SMALLER THAN Hillary’s at this exact point in her race vs. Trump. 
And we all know how that worked out.
Also, consider whether losing this person is actually a bad thing.

Hey - it worked for Toobin!
That would be awesome if it had any semblance of cleverness. Alas...
Annette my dear, that doesn’t work when you follow me! 
Come on now, do better.
Should prob unfollow me my dear.
Aww, sweetheart, that doesn’t work when you follow me. 
Better luck next time.
Btw, “pulling a Toobin” must become a thing. 
No one should ever have to find another euphemism for said act. 
This is absurd. I read all of the coverage yesterday thinking he was seen on cam pulling a Toobin. 
Now having watched it, it really does appear as if he was tucking in his shirt as he said. 
I get that many don’t like him-but this B.S. is just wrong.
“Laptop from hell”
MSNBC’s Joy Reid saying only time “pigs in a blanket,” etc has ever been chanted by BLM was at a protest 1x in NY &amp; not by BLM proper. 
That is a(nother) lie (below just one example of BLM *admitting* it).
 Oh & has anyone seen ⁦
@Kaepernick7
⁩’s socks?
Nah, just don’t suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome and can still engage in fair analysis. You wouldn’t understand.
MSNBC saying “an avalanche of lying” from DT. 
Now talking about when Maddow cried about what’s happening at the border.
Let’s hope!! 
Trump won this debate, handily. Biden wasn’t a force at all. 
Trump was substantive, on-point, well-tempered. 
Definitely helped himself, when it mattered most.
Biden has definitely said he will ban new fracking on federal lands.
This. ⬇️ https://t.co/KyptY0x6DL
Climate change. Again.
DT: “I’m the least racist person in this room.”
DT: first time I ever heard of BLM,  they were chanting “pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em like bacon.”
Biden going with Russian disinfo! 
After DNI explicitly said the laptop is NOTHING OF THE KIND.
Did Trump just say “laptop from hell”??
Biden: character is on the ballot.
Strong moment: DT: “I ran bc of you!”
Biden was ready on this exchange re: prison reform.
Trump not taking the bait on “systemically racist country” - touts record on prison reform.
Biden: “the fact of the matter is: there is institutionalized racism in America.”
DT: he’s been in gov’t 47 years, he never did a thing but label some “super predators.”
DT: “They don’t come back to the [immig] courts - only those with the lowest IQ.”
DT: “he had 8 years to fix it; he did nothing but build cages. 
He did nothing.”
Trump: “who built the cages Joe?”
“Do you have a plan to unite the kids at the border?” 
“We’re working on it very hard.”
Very very strong DT on minimum wage and leaving it to states.
Biden cribbing Obama: “i don’t see red states or blue states.”
“Billions and billions!” Drink!
Trump should have brought this version of himself to Debate #1 and insisted on a Debate #2 channeling this version. 
His poll numbers are going to go up.
Biden’s fave debate response: “Come on.”
Biden re Trump: “he’s a very confused guy. He thinks he’s running against someone else.”
Trump to @kwelkernbc “so far I do respect very much the way you’re handling this.”
Biden: “where’s the plan??” on covering pre-existing conditions if Obamacare goes down. Fair Q.
Is Joe Biden still here?
Trump saw something that made him believe the interrupting version of him did not go over well with required core voting groups.
DT w/the tell-it-like-it-is moment: he pivots off of China and looks at the audience. 
Typical politician. 
I’m not one. 
That’s why I won.
Trump disciplined- staying on Hunter, the emails, Joe’s alleged cut, etc.
These are empty calories without follow ups and a chance for them to really go back and forth. 
Box them in and make them stay on point.
I’m sorry but 30 secs on the Hunter allegations is a joke.
Not heard from Biden: those emails are fake. 
The laptop isn’t Hunter’s.
Ugh! That’s it??? A total pass!
Biden: “my son has not made money in terms of China.” 
How about Ukraine?
Yes! @kwelkernbc asking Biden about Hunter!! 
Good for her.
Biden: “show us [your taxes], just show us, stop playing around.”
DT: “you made 3.5m from China man, what’s that all about?”
Why is DT answering Biden on taxes (defense) rather than staying on Biden on offense?
Biden: “release your tax returns or stop talking about corruption!”
Biden: “I haven’t taken a penny from any country ever.”
DT: “you were getting a lot of money from Russia! 
You and your family... you owe an explanation to the American ppl... maybe right now.”
Trump’s control here shows his interruptions/aggression in first debate was a strategy. 
He can control himself just fine.
Biden re Rudy: “well, I shouldn’t... well, I will!” Behind these scenes, Biden’s ppl: NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yes! Let them debate/engage!
Trump is winning so far.
So far @kwelkernbc doing a nice job.
DT: “NY is a ghost town... putting up plexiglass is not the answer.  NY is dying.” DEPRESSING &amp; SAD, BUT TRUE.
Trump: “we have to open our country - the cure cannot be worse than the disease.”
DT: “I take full responsibility. But it’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault.”
DT: “Joe has a thing about basements!” - even Biden seemed to chuckle.
Biden denying calling Trump xenophobic *bc of travel ban* from China. 
So he just happened to drop that term re Trump within hours of the ban being announced?
Trump a lot more controlled, subdued tonight. More disciplined.
Welker: some say we will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. 2022??
Biden says Trump is “responsible for” the 220k+ dead from COVID. 
Do Americans really believe that? 
That it’s Trump’s fault?
Trump on COVID “I can tell you from personal experience” re what some say is a cure. Lemonade out of lemons!
Smug smile from Biden on “mics will be turned off” during other man’s 1st answer.
No family member or other person has “held stock for [Joe Biden].” 
Well, now, that doesn’t quite answer the Q, does it? 
Did Hunter collect $$ meant for dad? 
Strike a deal to do so?
That they may not have been “in business” together (as claimed below) d/n answer these Qs at all.
You guys look great! Lots of love!
Omg is he *always* a jerk?
“It’s extremely hard for me to watch him lie through his teeth and get away w/it.
The fact that he even had the time to write a book during the last 6 mos of a pandemic is incredible. 
Imagine if the gov of LA decided to write a book soon after Katrina hit?”
AN EXCELLENT Q
I haven’t said one negative word about K Welker and have only wished her luck!
😂 lol
Thank you Mr C and we are all good! 
No worries about ‘16!
Go for it! 
As long as you are younger and thinner
I think I’ve already made that clear
It’s fun being outside corporate media. 
Also we’ve been at the top of the podcast charts since our debut so thanks for listening! 
Trump bringing this guy - Bobulinski - to debate tonight. 😳 
Presser on site at 5p per @johnrobertsFox
Here is the most outrageous (meta?) part of the 60 Mins exchange:
Trump (re Biden) “he’s in the midst of a scandal.”
Leslie: “he’s not!”
Right - b/c the media won’t report on it. And then, when confronted w/the allegations, they say “no scandal to see here!”
Actually she tried to mock him (re: the economy) by saying “u know that’s not true,” &amp; then when he doubled down she retreated: “I’m not going to fact check u now.” 
But she just tried. 
In an effort to sound tough. & then didn’t have her facts ready. Ouch.
“Stormed out?” Oh please. 
This guy is brilliant! 
Love @JeremyDBoreing and you will too. 
Att’n @kwelkernbc @NBCNews:
“I would ask the Biden family to address the American people &amp; outline the facts... 
The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars through foreign entities...”
It’s back in the news today as Chris Pratt takes new fire for it.
@EllenPage says Hillsong hates gay ppl. 
Odd, since the first openly-gay person to ever hold a cabinet  position in the USA, @RichardGrenell, just told me today that it’s his church and how grateful he is to it: https://tinyurl.com/y4n298j7
Worth the read... 
Why is this deemed “sensitive content” when I see it tweeted by others??? Sensitive??
Keep reading you fool
Forgive the graphic nature of this, but this is so disturbing - look at these excerpts in James Lindsay’s two tweets below - this is grossly inappropriate for a fifth grader! 
They’re 10!! Abusive & wrong.
California parents: BEWARE.
Not-a-one. 
In today's episode of @MegynKellyShow I sit down with @RichardGrenell to discuss working for @realDonaldTrump, Hunter Biden, being a gay Republican, his faith and politics and his predictions for the election.

Uh oh! MANSPLAINER!
The UK’s Kemi Badenoch remains unafraid to tell the hard truths- like BLM is anti-capitalist, and that Black kids should not be taught that they are victims & whites, their oppressors.
So, maybe we can actually post stories about it now? Ask Biden (Joe &amp; Hunter) about it now? 
Surely now, the NYT, Wapo & others will pursue the story?
@coldxman and I had such a lovely, thoughtful exchange on so many tough subjects - sexism, race, police, etc. 
It’s been wonderful doing some press around my new podcast, and getting to spend time w/ppl like Coleman is the reason why.
She licks them every time we leave the apartment!
We have upped our pumpkin game, people.
I really hope ppl listen to this podcast. 
The last half hour, re the mssgs we send to girls/women, was really special to me.  
Why do we demonize stay-at-home motherhood? 
Why is more $$/power always prized? 
More than 1 friend has told me she cried listening to this pod.
LET’S HEAR FROM HUNTER!
H-was it ur laptop?
Did you leave it at a DE repair shop?
Did you arrange a mtg b/t Burisma’s #3 guy Pozharskyi & ur dad? Joe, did u attend that mtg?
H, did you cut a deal for $10m/year from Ye Jianming?
Were u negotiating another deal that wld pay ur dad?
This is absurd. 
Our family’s schools are thankfully open and operating safely and have done a great job of protecting the kids and teachers. 
It can be done if there is a willingness.
Open the damn schools.
My thanks to the fearless @abigailshrier, whose interview affected me profoundly. 
Thank you for the thought-provoking talk & for writing “Irreversible Damage.”
Check out my interview with her here:
Omg! Too perfect.
Yes, if we gals had a nickel for all the times we pleasured ourselves with active zoom calls going but thank goodness at least with the lens cov... oh wait. 
That’s not us. AT. ALL. 🤦‍♀️
I think I speak for, oh, pretty much everyone when I say STFU you absolute douchebag.
Thx for having me Joe Pags! 
Really enjoyed it! 
At a minimum, these wld be easy denials:
-Hunter Biden denies that the laptop in Q is his & that he ever gave a laptop to any repairman.
-Joe Biden explicitly denies that he ever met w/the Ukrainian official named in the NYP piece (not just that his calendar d/n/reflect the mtg).
Loved this @benshapiro - covered some dicey ground on this one! 
Thanks for having me. 
I think this is good for us as a people!
Class act @TheRealSambora responds to Jon Bon Jovi. 
An amazing THREAD ⬇️ and one that rightly gives credit to @JaniceDean for leading the way on holding  Cuomo accountable for his recklessness. 
How dare he celebrate his “leadership” on COVID?
WORTH YOUR TIME ⬇️⬇️
TGIF people 💕 Thunder 
Biden sounds good/coherent on ABC right now - talking about the country’s future/unity - has the “aw shucks” attitude he sometimes shows.
It’s definitely easier when the moderator lets you speak.
Trying to get excited by this town hall on ABC but confess — I’m struggling. You?
Yes
Seriously? 
Spoken like a man who’s never had a criminal running at him with a deadly weapon.
So far, this is not a town hall for voters, it is designed to appease the angry NBC employees/Dems who are pissed off Trump’s on NBC at all.
More masks! 
How many Q’s can we do on masks?
Wait - they knew they had an audience member asking a mask Q and they still spent 5 mins on masks pre-audience?
Yes! 
Good Q! 
How are you going to get the economy back on track. 
Leave it to the ER doc - no nonsense.
What on earth is happening with these Q’s?
This is already much better for Trump than the last debate.
Good for Trump for fighting back on this white supremacy Q - the 10,000th one.
Scully seems like a nice guy but C-SPAN did the right thing. 
Contrast w/MSNBC &amp; its host who made up a fake hacking to excuse her bigoted blog posts re LGBT+.

AGAIN. 
“Potentially harmful...”
Check out my latest episode with @AlanDersh.  
We covered the backlash he felt supporting Trump during impeachment, I asked him if he thought Jeffrey Epstein killed himself and whether or not he thinks OJ is guilty. 
Tune in to find out:
Insane ppl are attacking @maggieNYT for tweeting out this article, calling her a Trump hack. 
Grow up, Blue Checks. 
Love you too JD. 
You are a force for good in this world.
“Please, please like me” is actually a pretty fun, funny, and self-deprecating way of connecting. 
This is why so many ppl forgive Trump his jagged edges - he can laugh at himself.
Honestly - can our KIDS JUST GO TO SCHOOL????? 
I think this is the most personal I’ve gotten in an interview. 
@adamcarolla and I “went there” ... and then some. Appreciated the great talk.
-Comm’n on Pres. Debates really botched this. 
Had no right to unilaterally change debate to virtual. 
Should try hard to resurrect in-person debate.
-Also: if Trump is COVID-free, we need to hear it from someone other than Conley, who lied to us repeatedly.
Kids are sitting at home not able to go to school for others’ protection and ... this.
  Sick of this B.S. 
Oh sweetheart, you should unfollow me bc I have a lot to say.
Happy Columbus Day!
“Columbus Day is a time to remember that that which seems impossible rarely is. 
It is a day to...ask yourself what challenges you can face with strength and purpose.”
No they aren’t. 
Football and baseball have done just fine. 
Why don’t you take a look at what Adam Silver just said about political messages in the NBA before you try to lecture others.
So many ppl feel this way. 
They got political and the fans left in droves. 
How do you look this good at 37 weeks?
You look amazing!!
Also thx to the media which pours gasoline on any and every spark he ignites - no matter how big or small, all are treated like a 5-alarm fire.
Well said @JoeConchaTV
I interviewed @RealCandaceO for a wide-ranging interview on President Trump and how she came to support him, victimhood, racism in America, motherhood & more.

They can’t possibly go with this. 
How stupid do they think we are? 
This is insane. 
This cannot suffice.
Just dropped our latest episode of the @MegynKellyShow  - post VP debate analysis with @charlescwcooke, @krystalball, & @esaagar -check it out!
It’s not my job to “support” her, &amp; it’s not sexist to critique her.
He wasn’t demeaning her. 
He was making a point on policy.
Monster?
Is he *trying* to lose? 
How dare you compare my tweet, suggesting Kamala woman-up (meaning be her strongest, composed self) make less faces while Pence is speaking to a man who sexually abused, harassed & hurt so many women?
Ppl have lost their minds. 
I address on my podcast dropping later today.
Yes.
Sure, b/c absolutely no one criticized Trump for his behavior at the last debate. 
Commission on Pres. 
Debates announces (unilaterally, apparently) that next debate will be VIRTUAL. 
Trump: “Pathetic,” and NO. 
We won’t attend.
It’s there now!
Download “The Megyn Kelly Show” on your podcast app and hear my full reaction along w/ analysis from my panel tomorrow!
Holy Lord. 
Maddow: 
“Pence tried to steamroll Harris and the moderator and instead he looked (again) flaccid” ... 
N Wallace: “he looked limp and lame.” 
Steamroll? Limp & lame? 
Good Lord the hatred is overwhelming.
Nicole Wallace: 
“VP Pence appeared flaccid.”
 Omg I’m done.
Joy Reid saying Mike Pence interrupted continually and every woman knows what it is like to have that happen over and over - 
she was “momala” in that woman and it was very bad for Donald Trump.
Gayle King: 
“it was very telling that a fly landed on Mike Pence’s head when he was denying America’s systemic racism. 
The fly was like ‘say whaaat?’” 😳
Is anyone else wondering why we haven’t seen Pence more in this campaign?
Very nice answer by Pence to Brecklyn on Ginsburg &amp; Scalia and how “America always comes together.” 
Answer of the night.
Pence: 
“I think we’re going to win this election.”
Harris: 
“VOTE. Pls vote.”
Pence: 
“When Joe Biden was VP, the FBI actually spied on our campaign”
The fly is free and now getting a COVID test
Omg Susan Page needs to tell him
#flygate!
Does he have a fly on his head??
Pence: 
“Biden’s belief that law enforcement have an implicit bias against minorities is a great insult.”
Pence: 
“I trust our justice system.”
She won’t answer. 
Re court packing. Good on Pence for pointing it out.
The “I’m speaking, *I’m* speaking” thing worked at first. 
Now it’s getting old.
Pence: 
“The American ppl deserve an answer: are you and Biden going to pack the Supreme Court?”
No
Harris: 
“Biden and I are ppl of faith and it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith.” 
Media/Dems... ummm ... 
she doesn’t speak for us Handmaiden!
Pence on Amy Coney Barrett’s Catholicism: 
Don’t go there.
Pence: 
“Joe Biden opposes the raid on Osama Bin Laden!”
Pence: 
“these slanders are absurd.”
This is Harris at her strongest. 
(Re Trump and military)
Pence: 
“we destroyed the ISIS caliphate.”
Harris making the Iran deal sound like a fun campfire w/s’mores we were all enjoying until evil orange man ruined it.
Harris: 
“Trump has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world” 
Here we go on For Policy...
“There’s a weird obsession that Trump has had with getting rid of anything accomplished by Obama” FACT.
Is anyone else starting to fade?
This is so calm, soothing. 
The Smooth Jazz debate.  
Not like the “Get Off My Lawn” 
Debate last week.
China! Drink!
Pence: 
“lost the trade war with China?? 
Joe Biden never fought it.” 
Good counterpoint.
Harris: 
“you lost that trade war (with China). 
You lost.” 
Strong, simple. Check.
Instead of “like a man.” We can be stoic too
Take it like a woman. 
Don’t make faces.
Omg the head shake.
So far Susan Page doing a nice job.
Ok Karen. 
“Reigned over?”
Don’t smirk. 
Don’t shake your head. 
Don’t smile mockingly. Wait.
“There was a time when our country believed in science.” 
(Was it the time they said Covid would skip the BLM protesters?)
Pence projects “gentleman.” 
Tough to dislike. 
So far Kamala looks professional, calm. 
Should stop the head shaking.
Pence: same!
Page: have you and Biden had The Incapacitation Talk? 
Harris: dodges: 
I was the first female DA in my district and getting chosen as VP nom was wonderful.
Pence: 
“Stop playing politics with ppl’s lives -your continued undermining of confidence in a vaccine is unacceptable.”
Harris with good rebuttal - you failed to provide them with the truth to make those decisions
Pence: 
“We trust the American ppl to make choices about their health. 
We are about freedom.”
Pence is so much better than Trump at defending Trump
The plan is contact tracing?
This literally made me lol
Looking forward to this! 
See you in a few @scrowder!
Looking forward to it!
I don’t think media should be circulating the Claudia Conway postings. 
The family is obviously struggling w/a tough… 
I’ve tweeted about my friend @JoelleCosentino &amp; her amazing dance company thru which she was training &amp; empowering… 
Woah. 
nails it.
That “idea” has hurt and killed a lot of people.
I love, love, love this talk with @adamcarolla about cancel culture.
Man speaks the truth!
Listen here: https://t.co/kRCgbwqZMk
I know Richie, and he most definitely has his life together.
Happier than he’s ever been.
This is who @TheRealSambora is, and he very much “has his act together,” @jonbonjovi, as you well know.
“How Richie Sambora Helped Megyn Kelly's Son After Teacher's Death”
“There's not a day that goes by that I don't wish that Richie had his life together… 
In a weird way, it's because of his inability to get it together anymore that we went on and wrote This House Is Not For Sale.”
What a low-class attack on the guy who made you a star, Jon Bon Jovi.
@TheRealSambora is the most genuine, kind, giving friend, dad, human there is.
No one has a bad word re: him-except you, always you.
Guess you need att’n for your new album?
Sad.
“Subject” is very strong for any song by America.
Stop that right now.
For me it was my mom, Blondie, and “The Tide is High.”
P.s. Is Katie real?
Surely she’s trolling us with “putting a leash on a dog” is subjugation as is buckling a child seat”?
Dear Men: Katie doesn’t speak for us.
Dear Katie: being a strong woman doesn’t mean shaming men for common courtesy.
Some of us absolutely love it.

Please start by unfollowing me!
So much easier!
I actually hadn’t clicked thru to the article and I should have.
It’s just another “Trump is awful” piece - not one celebrating his possible death.
My bad - looks like WAPO actually only meant to tweet out its latest hate piece on Trump, which basks in how wonderful it would be if he loses, not dies.
The fact that you think this tweet, from the Washington Post,  was just fine if one buys that they didn’t know Trump had COVID when they sent it is further proof of your blinding hatred when it comes to DT, Tim.
Praying for you Dan. 💕

It’s really not hard.
Weird sweater!

It does look like I am naked!
Ha!
It’s just an off-the-shoulder sweater.
Curriculum night by zoom is not bad.
Best thing I have seen all day.
Try not to smile.
My second podcast - the first presidential debate!
Director Wray went on to clarify that the group is indeed a “movement,” a “real thing,” “not a fiction” that “engages in organized tactical activity at the local & regional level,” & it’s “dangerous.” 
To summarize this position w/“he said it’s an idea not an org” is dishonest.
I’m genuinely curious - toward whom do you think I am biased?
I’m there too!
Now!
Will be dropping our second podcast by Wed afternoon with complete post-debate analysis... and here’s a secret: 
we’ll have Ds AND Rs w/reaction.
Hope you will download & subscribe (it’s free) to The Megyn Kelly Show on Apple podcasts, etc.
Dems already saying there shouldn’t be any more debates.
Not a chance they cancel the others.
Can you imagine how weak Biden would look?
Surfed over to MSNBC - there is no Republican on the panel analyzing this debate.
And don’t say Nicole Wallace who is basically TV’s Jennifer Rubin.
Big winner of the night: Kanye?
Keep the moderator on cam &amp; give him/her the ability to cut the mics.
They will stop talking.
What a $&amp;@%show.
Biggest loser of this debate: us!
Wallace shutting down the Hunter line of attack isn’t going to please the Trump supporters.
Also - TENSE AND UNCOMFORTABLE exchange
Biden: “Antifa’s an idea, not an organization.”
Trump: “you gotta be kidding me.” 
Point: TRUMP
Biden’s retort was good - he puts gasoline on everything.
Biden: “there’s nothing we can’t do if we do it together!”
Protesters: raise the fist and say BLM or get the F away from your table. 🤔
Argh!! I wanted to hear Biden’s answer to that!!!
This is it: “why aren’t you saying the words law enforcement??”
Biden capable of landing blows when not interrupted
Annnddd... once again Biden ruins his good moment with a personal insult.
“He doesn’t want to let me answer bc he knows i have the truth” - best line from Biden so far
Trump took no real heat on taxes.
His biggest liability in this debate is what it is outside of this debate: looks like a bully.
Biden keeps erasing the advantage with name calling.
Strong answer again by Trump on his most vulnerable subject (COVID) arguing against the shutdowns.
My kids lol’ing about the “size of his mask” crack.
Biden takes what was a very strong answer on “do you trust him after all the lies” and ruins it by insulting Trump then seizes on.
Omg low road low road moment on “smart.”
This is Trump’s strongest answer.
On COVID.
Biden takes the bait: 
“will you shut up man?” That’s a fail for him.
Trump’s base will love his aggression; suburban moms and older voters?
Not so sure.
Biden calls Trump a clown before we hit the 18 min mark
Pocahontas!
Drink!
Biden can’t control Trump; keeps asking Wallace to help him.
Not a good look.
Handle it Mr. VP
Trump actually did prepare.
Biden on message: 
Obamacare, Obamacare, Obamacare...
#PresidentialDebate
Biden looks pale.
But then everyone does next to Trump.

Laughed out loud reading CCWC.
Well done.
Thx @meghan_daum -more is on the way!
Post debate analysis tomorrow
Thank you for taking the time to listen!
Bc Wallace or his prep team would have to have leaked it.
I know them all, and they are above reproach.
There is zero chance that’s true.
Here’s what we have coming up the rest of this week on my new podcast-launch week of the @MegynKellyShow:
Loved this talk with @RubinReport.
First time I have ever responded “Bite me” to a Q (not directed at Dave of course).
“[A] community activist who works in [an area w/] many of the city’s Black residents...[says she] is in favor of more police officers.
‘The [City Council] didn’t engage Black & brown people’ [on defunding police, leaving] this community & me unsafe.’”
Happy Birthday D - may this year be the best one yet. 💕
Here’s what we have coming up this week.
Launch week of the @MegynKellyShow:
Today: @ggreenwaldPost-debate show with @krystalball and @esaagar, @hughhewitt

I can't wait to hear what you think of the @MegynKellyShow.

The Q is tax evasion (illegal) v tax avoidance (legal - most people try it) in the NYT Trump taxes story.
But Trump is not the only rich presidential candidate trying to dodge as many taxes as possible.
Thunder = happiness &amp; calm.
People can see the emptiness of these racist attacks on @DanielCameronAG and know he followed the law.
As he put it earlier this week, “in a world that is forcing many of us to pick a side, I choose the side of justice.
I choose the side of truth.” Same.
Guys, they’re going to attack her decision to adopt two children.
Her mothering.
And her/her children’s race.
Say a prayer for Amy Coney Barrett and her family tonight, and for the lost souls who think this is ok.
So we’re all ok with open, bigoted attacks on Catholics now?
Just trying to keep up.
Hey @NYGovCuomo - @JaniceDean is not giving up.
She and the other grieving families deserve answers.
Great job JD!
An honest, unbiased & spot-on (as usual) legal take from @AndrewCMcCarthy on the Breonna Taylor case.
Harry &amp; M, in an undisguised attempt to gain pity” opted “to portray the Prince..as a victim of oppression...The entire British state had conspired to ensure that Harry-for no reason other than..being a Prince-had never enjoyed the right of the common man” 
Open the schools 
Starting next week...
Two Louisville PD officers shot last night (non-life threatening injuries)... two cops seen on camera being shot in execution attempt in Compton, & look at this video from Seattle.
Disgusting, stomach-turning terrorism.
This was done beautifully, heart-breakingly and with class.
Praying for you Dan.
The Get Out the Vote effort for Trump continues!
 They’re doing an amazing job!
 (Ps - watch this video. 
 Just watch it.) 
This (and Bork) was the beginning of it all.
It’s the heart of the “you reap what you sow” argument against the Dems.
They broke the norms first.
