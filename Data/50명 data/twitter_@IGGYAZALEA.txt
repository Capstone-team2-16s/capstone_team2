Watching ppl on trampolines on tiktok, gtg. 
feels like it’s every 75
It’s soooo long in between seasons I really forget about it whenever it’s on TV.
🤷‍♀️ I dunno I really don’t watch them if I’m being honest. 
Is trampoline a sport now? 
(Not a joke)
I crack my own self up mannnnn help!
Hahahaslslakzkanzka a 
Then why is your nose so far up my pussy tryna catch a whiff
Why didn’t you make a video for the others, y’all so mean lmao
Did anyone ever find a CD player for the remix or nah? Lol
I have no music I’m promoting right now...
I go thru phases where I have to eat pizza literally three times a week and then suddenly for months I don’t give a fucccckkk about it.
I’m sorry pizza. I do love you.
Times worth more than money.
The wildest part about “the crown” on nextflix is that the queen carried her purse around her house. 
Imagine having a house so big, you need to take a purse to the kitchen.
My son is my happiness. 💖
Thanks!
The fabric I’m using now has a bit more stretch in it than before so that the sizes have more ability to be a bit transitional.
Thankyou!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Yes I will NEVER sell you something that is just a money grab, I genuinely love designing and w😊creating products - it brings me joy to see you all happy and enjoying something I made. 💖
Ifight bts about both those things soooo hard for y’all you don’t even know!
I really really care that you can have something awesome and not have to have a lot of money to afford it.
Yes we didn’t give up, we troubleshooted until we found the perfect application and color balance and I’m so happy, knowing YOU will all be happy.
Great job to everyone on the merch team! Thankyou!
But finally we have cracked it!
They will be on the way to you all shortly! Woooooo!!!!! 
I may be late but bitch we will always always always give you what we promised!!!
I can’t even tell you how stressed I’ve been and how many times & samples it’s taken to get these damn hoodies to print and actually look like metal.
They kept just looking grey & I’ve been so worried because I hate to disappoint you when you’re always so happy with my merch! 1/2
Me and trixie are a little bit legenderic this week. 
💖🥰 
Vander_ _ _ _
I’ve actually made a lot of new friends this year and that’s always been very hard for me my whole life!
So I’m kinda proud of myself to be overcoming a bit of my social anxiety.
I spat my drink out
😹 
😩😹💀 
Hahaha 
Right!
Who’s gonna find a CD player first.... 
I will put it on streaming!
But wanted ppl to have the exclusive as a fun bonus.
No iTunes tho. 
💖
I know!
But it’s hard when you are signing thousands to have to pay such close attention to that so - 
Back was much easier and safer.
The remix is amazing has anyone heard it?!?!
I kept it on the CD and off iTunes so you had a lil exclusive
It was hard to sign and not write over either me or Tinashe because of the picture.
I would consider it disrespectful to sign my name over another artists picture, so I stuck to the back on most for this reasoning.
🥰 
I signed the inserts first this time and I’m so glad because I know you love collecting them & this way we can shrink wrap over and it’s always mint if you’re saving it. 🥰
🥰
What y’all eat for dinner?  
I had jam drop cookies
You passed over into the light. Now you’re at ✨peace✨ 
Hahaha no just my shitty social skills 
Same!
Girl no one I’m the asshole who ghosts.
It’s someone ghosts you and then texts you again out of the blue - 
That’s a haunting.
Hahaha I alreadyyyyy knew
No💖
Hahaha and shark boy too hahahaha why are all my nicknames always animals 💀
Hahahaha!
Who talkin shit about me now, lemme find outttt!
Hahahaha 
My grandpa calls me stretch since I was little because I’m tall.
No because I feel names are very personal and I never wanted strangers to be able to use mine when talking shit and putting weirdo negative energy on it. 
Gotta protect your vibe.
Sometimes I call him puppy dog boy because he licks everything and crawls and is so cute like a lil puppy.
Hahahahahahahahaha
Yes a lot of people do actually.
He will call me mama! Period!
Even they call me iggy so that should let know know - 
It’s a VERY small number of people who call me by any other name.
We just know!
I dunno it’s weird! 
We just always know when it’s directed at him & when it’s directed at me.
Ppl think I speak in the third person all the time because they don’t know I’m referring to someone else with the same name.
No usually the 1% call me a mix of both names depending on who we are around etc. 
but if someone in the 99% me that then it’s like 👁👄👁
nahhhhhhhh not feelin thattttt
99% of the people in my life call me iggy & I prefer that except for the 1% that know me that well that it just hits different if they say my real name because it feels cozy.
Lol.
Exactly. Like I gotta KNOW you. 
Like you know my mama level, 
You know my deep dark secrets n shit.
Only a VERY select group of people in my life are allowed to call me Amethyst. 
If I let you call me that you are elite.
💖
Hahaha I could fed order them and show you my recommendations !
Oh for sure I will do that one after Christmas! 
What kind of Christmas video should I make? 
Christmas make up? Decorate a wreath? My ten favorite things about Christmas?
Ranking my best to worst gifts ever?
Babies sleep in weird ass positions, 
Your back don’t hurt bro?
😝
I don’t wanna “become a YouTuber” just think it could be fun to post videos from time to time that are not music related.
Def gonna do it! But probably in 2021 since this year is cursed. 💖
Wow this is really cute, I love it 😻
Any other moms who can’t stop dropping weight after having a baby?
(Not a brag, genuinely wanna hear if you had this happen) 
I don’t try/want to lose weight but it’s literally just shedding off me, is it hormonal?
Should I be concerned? 20lbs lighter than pre baby and counting
💖
Bro I was ready!
2020 I came to fight!
Literally!
I got half the procedure right but then driving home I realized I forgot a really important step that could’ve made our situation so much better.
Like bitch!!!
I could’ve saved our lives way better! 
But it’s hard to remember what to do in emergencies when they are happening.
You forget stuff that’s simple.
FUCK! At least it wasn’t real life. 😹😩🥴
you can count on me to kinda safe a life.
I have moderately good ideas.
So I thought I was in a life or death emergency today (long story, I’ll explain later, I wasn’t)
I was happy I got a lot of the safety procedure correct - but then driving home I realized I forgot the BIGGEST part/first thing I’m meant to do. 
And now I’m kicking myself! Argh!
Facts! 👁👄👁
Til my ears bleed!
Also 300 lawsuits sounds wildly entertaining I can’t wait to watch trump lose 300 more times!
She is the main character! 
Suddenly I love 2020
Every time I see everyone celebrating I just cry I’m so fucking happy! Wooooooo!!!! 
The plot twist we all needed. 
These 2020 writers really ended the show on a high note, I loved the season finale.
Beyond.
This is the America I wanted to come and be a part of again.
Thankyou to everyone who voted, on behalf of so many of us who live here but can not.
Thank you!!!!
There is no COVID cure babe stay updated, they’ve already said you won’t be getting that.
Most you can expect is better medication for treatment.
Voting stats say that it’s facts but go off.
The best part is most of the trump ppl live in bumble fuck nowhere so they aren’t in the city to fuck up our celebrations
I’m so happpppppppyyyyyyy 💖 
The evil has been defeated! 
💖💖💖💖
its goin down????
I love this song! Turn it up!!!!
Oh god! I should - I love to drag myself.
My tiktok says hi!
Exactly!
Not weekly like the pros or anything but maybe 1 or 2 a month for fun? 🤷‍♀️ 
I’ve been enjoying being a guest so much on my friends YouTube channels that I’m thinking about making my own... 
would you guys like that idea too?
It’s peanut butter jelly timeeeee
@queenkimeow Nah I have years before I will be able to, you have to have held a green card for a while before becoming eligible.
I hate Donald trump and if you like him: I hate you too. 
Now what.
No, you can’t vote with a green card.
😈
🥶
Hit the stage ass shaking like I’m nervous 
Yes gawd!
If you can’t happily be alone you’re weak.
There, I said it.
Grown ups shouldnt need babysitters.
Finally someone has the clock! 😻 
I’ve been saying I’ll make a grilled cheese sandwich for 3 days now 🤷‍♀️😹
Y’all don’t like my cooking anyway. 
😹🤷‍♀️
You got a Kentucky fried terminator serving the chicken! 🥺
😻
What make up should I do next ?
I knew I should’ve added a bang but I wouldn’t have had any room to draw the brows! Lol
How come no one peeped I was trying to serve a baby Mattel hairdo in my video with @trixiemattel 😹🤷‍♀️💖🥺 
And I’ll refollow every time!
Not too bad for a hot ass mess!

Of course!
If I you can believe it, we shot it in my garage with some barb wire and a painted sheet.
Hahaha! 
It must be tradition that I shoot things twice. Just scrolled past this looking through the photos on my phone.
It’s not cold where iam either really but if it’s overcast then at this point, I’m bringing out the sweaters.
Fuck it.
Good morning, sweater season is upon us!
I know this is so random but please 
I love pizza. 😢
If 2020 takes my fave pizza place I’m really about to lose it. 
I just read village pizza in LA might be closing. 😩😖😢
