Unbelievable.
I’d been his customer for years and had no idea he was a barber.

I got fired from my job at the bank today.
An old lady asked me to check her balance - so I pushed her over.
Want more jokes ?
I asked my wife if I was the only one she’d been with. 
She said yes, all the others had been nines and tens.
Next joke in 10 minutes
The man who invented Velcro died.

WHAT AN INCREDIBLE WOMAN!
I went to a psychic and knocked on her front door. 
She yelled “who is it?”. 
So I left.
Working out is like a drug to me.
